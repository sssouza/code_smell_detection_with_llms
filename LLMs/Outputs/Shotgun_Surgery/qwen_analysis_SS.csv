   - RSA encryption and decryption methods (`rsaEncryptByPublic`, `rsaEncryptByPrivate`, `rsaDecryptByPublic`, `rsaDecryptByPrivate`) have very similar implementation details involving Cipher initialization, key usage, and exception handling.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic for handling exceptions and converting byte arrays to hex strings and vice versa is repeated across multiple methods.
   - Cipher instances are consistently obtained and initialized in a very similar manner across different encryption and decryption methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Multiple methods interact with external security libraries and classes (Cipher, KeyGenerator, MessageDigest, etc.), suggesting that a change in these external libraries or requirements would require similar changes across multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changing the way exceptions are handled, the Cipher algorithm, or key generation process would likely require updates in multiple methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   This file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, suggesting potential Shotgun Surgery. Similarities in exception handling, Cipher usage, and key handling methods indicate that changes in these patterns would necessitate widespread modifications."

This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While the file does contain several methods that could be considered similar in that they process different aspects of classloaders, they are distinct enough in their functionalities. There is no indication of duplicated or repeated logic that would suggest Shotgun Surgery. Each method appears to have a specific purpose, and changes in one area do not necessarily imply changes in others."
AclException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   - There are multiple constructors in the `AclException` class that perform similar tasks, but they are constructors initializing the exception with different sets of parameters. This is not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic within the constructors is not repeated; each constructor handles a different combination of parameters and calls the appropriate parent constructor.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods in this file do not interact broadly with other classes. They are focused on initializing and providing access to the fields of the exception class.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the business rule or data structure (like adding a new field) would require changes in multiple constructors and accessor methods, but these are localized within the class and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery involving other files.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The repetitive elements are typical for an exception class handling various initialization scenarios."
GeneralAppIdDecoder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains methods like `isStillNumeric`, `isStillIsoIec646`, and `isStillAlpha`, which perform similar checks but on different types of data.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is a pattern of repeated logic in methods such as `decodeNumeric`, `decodeIsoIec646`, and `decodeAlphanumeric` where they check bit values, parseInts, and handle special cases.

Widespread External Interactions:
The methods in this file primarily interact with the `BitArray` and internal classes like `DecodedInformation`, `DecodedChar`, and `DecodedNumeric`. The interactions don’t suggest a widespread impact on many other classes.

Change Impact Within the File:
A change in the structure of `BitArray` or the logic of decoding would affect multiple methods, but this appears to be due to the nature of the task rather than a code smell. Methods within the same decoding logic are coupled, but this is within the context of a decoder and seems logical.

Summary Judgment:
While there are repetitive structures and duplicated logic within specific decoding tasks, there is no indication that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places across different files. The repetition is localized and necessary for the decoding process."

LinkedTreeMap.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose such as `put`, `get`, `remove`, and methods for maintaining the tree structure.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or nearly duplicated logic across the methods or classes within the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods do not interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes elsewhere. They mostly interact with internal Node objects and data structures.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While there are many methods that manipulate nodes and the tree structure, they are not tightly coupled based on business rules that would require many updates for a small change. For example, changes in node restructuring due to AVL balancing would affect only closely related methods.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are mostly self-contained, and changes are often localized to specific functionalities."
SocketIOChannelInitializer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There is no duplicated or repeated logic in the file. Each method serves a unique construction purpose.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The file interacts with `IErrorCode` but does not exhibit interactions with a wide range of other classes in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Changes to the `IErrorCode` interface or the `RuntimeException` superclass would affect the file, but since these are contracts, changes are less frequent and not small, similar edits across many places.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as it contains a straightforward exception class with no repetitive logic or widespread interactions that would necessitate many small changes in response to a minor requirement change."
SaOAuth2Template.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Widespread External Interactions:
While there are interactions with multiple classes (e.g., `MessageStore`, `Broker2Client`), the methods in this file do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

Change Impact Within the File:
A change in the business rule or data structure used by this file, like changes in `SendMessageRequestHeader` or the logic in `processRequest`, would likely require changes in a few related methods rather than many methods.

Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are specific to setting up and testing the message reply processing, and changes would typically affect a limited number of related methods."
NodeTraversor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods `traverse(NodeVisitor visitor, Node root)` and `filter(NodeFilter filter, Node root)` perform similar traversal logic but handle different types of operations (visiting vs. filtering).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic for traversing the nodes (while loop, moving through siblings and parents) is duplicated between `traverse` and `filter` methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact primarily with `Node` and `Element` objects, but this interaction does not suggest widespread changes due to a small change in requirements.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in node traversal logic would affect both `traverse` and `filter` methods, but these are primarily internal to these methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there is some duplication of traversal logic, the impact of changes seems localized to these methods, and they are largely different in their intent (visiting vs. filtering). Therefore, this file does not clearly indicate Shotgun Surgery."
DirectoryBrowserSupport.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods in this file seem to perform distinct tasks such as serving files, handling different file formats, and pattern scanning. There are no methods that appear to be performing nearly identical tasks.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic: While there are methods that handle similar logic, such as `serveFile` and `patternScan`, they are not exact duplicates and serve related but distinct functionalities. There is no widespread duplication of logic.

Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with a variety of classes and utilities (e.g., `StaplerRequest`, `StaplerResponse`, `VirtualFile`), but these interactions are necessary for the functionality provided by the class and do not suggest a Shotgun Surgery smell.

Change Impact Within the File: A change in requirements, such as altering how files are served or indexed, would impact specific methods rather than many small changes across multiple methods.

Summary Judgment: This file does not demonstrate signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the absence of Shotgun Surgery."
ExcelWriter.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- Multiple `write` methods (`write(List data, Sheet sheet)`, `write(List data, Sheet sheet, Table table)`, `write0()`, `write1()`) perform similar tasks with slight variations, suggesting they are likely redundant if `write(List data, WriteSheet writeSheet)` and `write(List data, WriteSheet writeSheet, WriteTable writeTable)` are used as intended.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- Deprecated methods like `write0` and `write1` are essentially the same as the non-deprecated `write` methods.

Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods frequently interact with classes like `WriteSheet`, `WriteTable`, `Sheet`, `Table`, indicating that changes in these related classes would necessitate changes here.

Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes to the `WriteSheet`, `WriteTable`, `Sheet`, or `Table` classes would require updates in multiple methods within `ExcelWriter` since many methods depend on these classes.

Summary Judgment:
- The presence of deprecated methods that duplicate functionality and the reliance on external classes suggest that a small change could impact multiple methods, indicating potential Shotgun Surgery."
MethodInfo.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The file contains getter and setter methods for each field, but they are standard and not repetitive in a way that suggests they would need similar changes due to a small requirement change.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no duplication or repeated logic in the file. Each method is specific to a single field.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- The methods do not interact with any external classes or systems, they only manage their own fields.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes to the fields (like renaming) would require updating the corresponding getter and setter method names, but this is a small and localized change.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. It contains standard boilerplate code for a simple data class with no indication that a single requirement change would necessitate multiple small edits across the file."
ApolloDataSourceFactoryBean.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

- The file mainly contains getter and setter methods, which are typical and not repetitive in the context of Shotgun Surgery.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no duplicated or repeated logic within this file.

Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods in this file primarily interact with `ApolloDataSource` and `Converter` classes. There is no widespread interaction with many different classes that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

Change Impact Within the File:
- If a business rule or data structure used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only the methods directly impacted by the change, not many methods.

Summary Judgment:
- This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as there are no repetitive methods, duplicated logic, or widespread interactions that would indicate a need for many small edits in multiple places with a small change in requirements."
UmsMemberService.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

5. Summary Judgment:
- This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method is distinct and serves a unique purpose."
BillboardParticleBatch.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `putVertex` methods and `fillVertices` variants for different alignment modes. However, these methods are structured to handle specific sub-tasks and are not repetitive in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There are some commented-out sections that show different alignment modes being processed, but the active code does not show direct duplication of logic. The `putVertex` method is reused with different parameters where appropriate.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The methods interact with various graphics classes like `Mesh`, `Shader`, and `Renderable`, but these interactions do not necessarily suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods within this file.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Modifying the `vertices` structure or adding a new alignment mode would impact multiple methods, such as `setVertexData`, `fillVerticesGPU`, `fillVerticesToViewPointCPU`, and `fillVerticesToScreenCPU`. However, these changes are concentrated within specific methods rather than scattered across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
While there are indications that adding or modifying alignment modes would be non-trivial and might require changes in multiple methods, the current structure of the file does not clearly show that a small change in requirements would lead to many small edits in multiple places."
BrokerController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

### Summary Judgment:
While the `BrokerController` class is large and manages various components and processes, there are no evident patterns of repeated methods or similar logic that would require widespread changes for a minor requirement alteration. The file does have a high number of methods and fields managing different aspects of the broker, which might suggest complexity, but not necessarily repetitive changes due to small requirements changes."
StringUtils.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
    - The file contains methods like `trimLeadingWhitespace`, `trimTrailingWhitespace`, and their counterparts for characters, which indicate some similarity but are distinct operations.
    - The `replace` and `delete` methods perform similar tasks but are distinct.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
    - The file primarily has distinct methods with their own specific logic, but some methods like `startsWithIgnoreCase` and `endsWithIgnoreCase` share similar logic in handling case-insensitive string comparisons.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
    - Methods within the file primarily interact with `String` and `StringBuilder` objects with some methods interacting with `Throwable` and other classes like `Properties`. These interactions are not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
    - Changes to a data structure or method signature used in multiple methods could have an impact, but the methods are designed to be standalone utilities, so changes to one utility would not necessitate changes to others.

5. Summary Judgment:
    - The file shows a collection of utility methods, each with its specific purpose. There isn't evidence of Shotgun Surgery since methods are distinct and changes to one would not typically require changes to others."
PacketEncoder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some similar logic patterns, like handling attachments and encoding data, they are not repetitive to the point indicative of Shotgun Surgery. Each method has distinct functionalities.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some duplicated logic, such as handling attachments and encoding packet data, but these are encapsulated in their own methods (`encodePacket`, `encodePackets`, `encodeJsonP`). This reduces redundancy.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods do interact with other classes like `Packet`, `JsonSupport`, and `ByteBuf` but do not suggest that a change would require many similar changes elsewhere.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to data structures like `Packet` or methods like `encodePacket` would impact related methods, but the dependencies seem to be well-managed and encapsulated within the respective methods.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the provided file, it does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are well-defined, and there is no indication that a small change would require many small edits in multiple places."
FastByteArrayOutputStream.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
- Methods like `toString(String charsetName)` and `toString(Charset charset)` are similar, but they are not repetitive; they allow for different ways to specify the charset.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- No significant patterns of duplicated logic are apparent.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods interact primarily with `FastByteBuffer` and standard Java classes (`OutputStream`, `Charset`, `IOException`). No single external interaction stands out as requiring widespread similar changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes to `FastByteBuffer` usages would affect several methods, but these changes would not be scattered or numerous; they would be focused around the buffer interactions.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery; typical changes would likely affect a few related methods rather than necessitating many small edits across the file."
BinaryRedisPipeline.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

This file primarily defines an interface with numerous method declarations for interacting with a Redis database. The methods are individual and specific to different Redis commands, indicating that changes to one method likely only affect the functionality of that specific Redis operation. There are some deprecated methods and overloaded methods that perform similar tasks, but these are not extensive enough to indicate widespread changes required for a small change in requirements. Thus, there is no strong evidence of Shotgun Surgery in this file."
LineTransformationOutputStream.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file does not contain many methods that perform similar tasks. There are distinct methods for handling end of line (`eol`), writing data (`write`), closing the stream (`close`), and trimming EOL characters (`trimEOL`).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no pattern of duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file do not interact with many different classes. They primarily interact with `ByteArrayOutputStream2` and `OutputStream`, and their use is straightforward.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - If a business rule or method signature used in this file changed, it wouldn’t necessarily require updating many methods in this file. For example, changes to the `eol` method or how the `ByteArrayOutputStream2` is managed would only affect a few specific methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are clearly defined with specific tasks, and changes to one method wouldn't typically necessitate changes in others."
RedissonObject.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some methods that perform similar tasks, such as `migrate` and `copy`, they interact with different Redis commands (`MIGRATE` and `MIGRATE` with `COPY` option respectively) and contain unique logic or context (e.g., the `COPY` parameter).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There are no patterns of repeated logic across methods. Methods like `sizeInMemoryAsync` and `deleteAsync` are specific to their operations and do not repeat substantial logic found elsewhere.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods frequently interact with `commandExecutor` to perform various Redis operations, but these interactions are specific to each method’s functionality and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in the business rules or command signatures would likely impact only relevant methods. For example, changes to `commandExecutor.encode(codec, value);` would affect only encoding-related methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method encapsulates its functionality with little redundancy or overlap in changes that a single requirement modification would necessitate across multiple methods."
DokanyVolume.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No obvious repetition of methods performing similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No duplicated or repeated logic in the methods provided.

3. Widespread External Interactions: While the file interacts with several external classes, the interactions do not suggest a shotgun surgery smell.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures within this file would likely affect specific methods rather than many small changes throughout.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the provided file, there are no clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
AnalysisContext.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery  
The file defines an interface `AnalysisContext` with a series of methods that provide access to various types of holders and metadata related to Excel reading. There are no repetitive methods or duplicated logic evident. Methods interact with different types of holders (`ReadWorkbookHolder`, `ReadSheetHolder`, `ReadRowHolder`) but this interaction appears consistent and necessary for its purpose. A change in the business rules or data structures used in this file would likely not require updating many methods within it, as the file defines a consistent and clear API for interacting with Excel data."
ClassLoaderModel.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains getter and setter methods for each field, which is typical for a model class and not necessarily indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There are no patterns of duplicated logic within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file do not interact with many different classes beyond the standard Java collections and the model-specific classes (like ClassSetVO, ClassDetailVO, etc.).

4. Change Impact Within the File: While changes to the data structures (e.g., changing from `List<String>` to `Set<String>`) would require updating each relevant setter and getter, this is a common scenario for model classes and not typically a sign of Shotgun Surgery unless the changes would be widespread across many files.

5. Summary Judgment: There are no specific signs in this file that a small requirement change would necessitate many small edits across multiple places. The file appears to be a straightforward model class with typical getter and setter patterns."
MethodRoadie.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `runWithTimeout` and `runTest` are similar in structure, both calling `runBeforesThenTestThenAfters`. However, they are not repetitive in the context of shotgun surgery as they perform distinct operations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplication of logic within the methods. The structure of method calls is consistent, but not duplicated across numerous places within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact primarily with `ExecutorService`, `Callable`, `Future`, and other classes in the testing framework. These interactions are not indicative of widespread changes across many methods if a single class changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the method signature of `runBeforesThenTestThenAfters`, `runTestMethod`, `runBefores`, `runAfters`, or `addFailure` would affect multiple methods. However, these methods have specific responsibilities and changes are unlikely to be small, repetitive, or numerous.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits in multiple places. The file is structured with distinct methods handling different aspects of test execution, not showing the shotgun surgery pattern."
StubConnection.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Many methods throw `SQLException` conditionally, but this is typical for JDBC implementations and doesn't necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some duplication in checking `throwException` to throw `SQLException`, but this is a common pattern in JDBC mock/stub implementations.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with various external classes (e.g., `SQLException`, `CallableStatement`, `PreparedStatement`), but this is expected for a JDBC connection implementation.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the `throwException` logic would require updates across multiple methods, but these are related to error handling and specific to this mock/stub class.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are some repetitive patterns and interactions, the file does not show evidence of Shotgun Surgery, as the repetitive elements are consistent with implementing a mock JDBC connection class."
ExpandedProductParsedResult.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains mostly getter methods for each field, which is a common practice and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic in the provided code.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file do not interact with many different classes. They primarily get or set values of fields and perform operations like equals and hashCode.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changing a business rule or method signature used in this file would require updating specific methods or fields, but not in a way that suggests widespread changes. For example, changing the format of dates would require changes in the getter methods related to dates, but this is a specific change.

5. Summary Judgment: There are no signs in this file that indicate Shotgun Surgery. The file is structured around a single purpose with clear separation of concerns for each attribute of the product."
SaFoxUtil.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - `joinParam` and `joinSharpParam` methods are similar in functionality with slight differences in the symbol (`?` vs `#`).
   - `convertStringToList` and `convertListToString` are not extremely similar but both deal with converting between strings and lists.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are repeated patterns in string concatenation and conversion in methods like `convertStringToList` and `convertListToString`.
   - The URL handling around `encodeUrl` and `decoderUrl` both handle exceptions in the same way.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods such as `encodeUrl` and `decoderUrl` interact with external libraries (`URLEncoder`, `URLDecoder`), but the interaction is consistent and localized.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in URL encoding/decoding might affect `encodeUrl` and `decoderUrl`.
   - Changes in date formatting would only affect `formatDate`.
   - Changes in list/string conversion logic might affect `convertStringToList`, `convertListToString`, `convertStringToArray`, and `convertArrayToString`.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Although there are some similar methods and duplicated logic patterns, the impact of changes on this file seems localized. No single change would necessitate numerous small changes across the file."
Stage.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains several methods that handle different types of input events (touchDown, touchDragged, touchUp, mouseMoved, scrolled, keyDown, keyUp, keyTyped), but these methods are not performing repetitive tasks but rather handling distinct events appropriately.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, such as setting up and handling InputEvent objects in multiple methods, but this repetition is necessary for handling different kinds of input events and cannot be avoided.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file interact with various classes like Batch, Camera, Graphics, and Input, but these interactions are necessary to perform their specific tasks and are not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to components like the Viewport or how InputEvents are handled would require changes in multiple methods, but this is intrinsic to the functionality of the Stage class and not a symptom of Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are well-structured to handle their specific purposes without excessive duplication or unnecessary complexity that would necessitate widespread changes."
Finance.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, there are no methods in this file that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method handles a distinct financial detail (credit card numbers, BIC, IBAN).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no evidence of duplicate logic across methods. Each method implements its own logic for generating financial details.

3. Widespread External Interactions: While methods do rely on the `Faker` object for generating values and formatting, the interactions are not widespread or suggest that a change in `Faker` would require similar changes in many places.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If the data structure or method signature used by `Faker` were to change, it would impact several methods that call it. However, this is more about dependency management rather than Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method is distinct and responsible for generating a specific financial detail with its own logic."
AdminBrokerProcessor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

While the file `AdminBrokerProcessor.java` contains a large number of methods, each method performs a distinct function related to processing different admin commands in the RocketMQ broker. The methods are not repetitive or forwarding calls in a way that suggests a large number of small changes would be necessary for a small change in requirements. The methods primarily handle different aspects of broker administration such as topic management, configuration updates, ACL configurations, and more. Changes to a single functionality (like topic management) would likely only affect the related methods and not necessitate small changes across many unrelated methods."
PreparedStatementHandler.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods `update`, `batch`, `query`, and `queryCursor` all cast the `Statement` to `PreparedStatement` and call `execute` on it. However, the subsequent actions differ.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repetition in casting `Statement` to `PreparedStatement` and calling `execute()`. But the methods perform different operations after execution.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods interact with several classes (`PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`, `KeyGenerator`, `RowBounds`, `ResultHandler`, `BoundSql`), but the interactions seem specific to method purposes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in `PreparedStatement` or the logic within `execute()` would affect all methods that call execute, but these methods also perform other distinct tasks, limiting broad changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there is some repetition, the methods perform different tasks and changes would likely be localized rather than requiring many small edits across methods for a single requirement change."
SmsFlashPromotionProductRelationServiceImpl.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods in this file are performing distinct CRUD operations and a count operation, which do not appear to be repetitive or similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are no clear patterns of logic duplication. Each method handles its own specific logic related to different database operations.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with two external classes: `SmsFlashPromotionProductRelationMapper` and `SmsFlashPromotionProductRelationDao`, but these interactions seem focused and do not suggest widespread changes required elsewhere.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the `SmsFlashPromotionProductRelation` model or the methods' signatures would require updating these methods, but the changes do not seem to propagate in a shotgun surgery pattern within this file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method is relatively contained and focused on a specific task."
PrefixPluginLogger.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the file contains methods that perform distinct tasks such as prefix retrieval, logger initialization, and message logging. No repetitive or similar methods are present.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, the file does not show any duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file primarily interact with logging-related classes and structures (from Log4j), which suggests a focused interaction rather than widespread changes due to external modifications.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If the business rule regarding logging or the data structure of markers were to change, it might impact the file, but the extent seems limited.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
BitMatrix.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains methods that perform similar tasks, like setting, unsetting, and flipping bits, but these are fundamental operations on a bit matrix and are not redundant.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There are no clear patterns of duplicated logic. Similar calculations (like calculating the bit offset) occur in multiple methods but are necessary for the operations they perform.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in this file mostly interact with the BitArray class, but this is expected given the functionality of handling bit matrices.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
While changes in data structure or bit manipulation logic within this file could affect many methods, these are core functionalities and would be expected to require changes across methods that interact with the bits in a matrix.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. Methods are logically grouped and changes to their core functionality would naturally require adjustments to multiple methods due to the nature of bit matrix operations."
JobTriggerPoolHelper.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are multiple methods, they do not seem to perform similar small or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose (starting/stopping the thread pool, adding triggers, etc.).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no obvious repeated logic in the file. The logic within methods is specific to its role.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods interact with external classes and objects (like `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `XxlJobTrigger`), but this interaction does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would affect specific methods rather than many methods. For example, changing the thread pool size or trigger retry logic would only impact a few places.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
MigrationRunController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains methods like `back()`, `migrate()`, `migrationProgressChanged()`, and `migrationRequiresInput()` but they are not similar or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic for setting the `vault.stateProperty().transition()` is repeated in different error handling blocks within the `migrate()` method, indicating some duplication.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with various classes (`Vault`, `KeychainManager`, `Tasks`, etc.), but these interactions are specific to the migration process and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in the migration process, passphrase handling, or vault state transitions might require updates in multiple places, but these changes are specific to the migration functionality.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there is some repeated logic, it is not extensive or widespread enough to indicate Shotgun Surgery. The file seems to be structured around a single responsibility (handling migration) and does not show signs of requiring many small changes across many methods due to a small requirements change."
Internet.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Some methods like `emailAddress`, `safeEmailAddress`, and `userAgent` have similar structures but do not perform repetitive tasks that indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some duplication in the arguments passed to `fakeValuesService().resolve` and the use of `StringUtils` methods, but it doesn't suggest widespread duplication influencing Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with `Faker`, `FakerIDN`, and `StringUtils`, but there is no indication that a change in these interactions would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the way `fakeValuesService().resolve` is used or the structure of `FakerIDN` would affect multiple methods, but this is not specific to small business rule changes but rather to changes in the underlying libraries or data structures.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While there are some repetitive method patterns and external interactions, they do not indicate the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
AllMembersSupplier.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods `getSingleDataPointFields` and `getDataPointsFields` are nearly identical, performing very similar tasks with only the annotation class differing.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: `addMultiPointFields` and `addSinglePointFields` share a similar logic structure for iterating over fields and adding potential assignments.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods like `addMultiPointFields` and `addSinglePointMethods` interact with various classes (`FrameworkMethod`, `ParameterSignature`, `FrameworkField`), suggesting that changes in their interaction patterns could impact multiple areas.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to how data points are validated or added (e.g., `sig.canAcceptType`, `sig.canAcceptValue`) would likely require changes across several methods (`addMultiPointFields`, `addSinglePointFields`, `addMultiPointMethods`, `addSinglePointMethods`).

5. Summary Judgment: The presence of nearly identical methods, similar logic structures, and widespread interactions suggest that a small change in requirements could necessitate many small edits throughout the file."
AwtCodec.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The `write` method and `parseFont`, `parseColor`, `parseRectangle`, `parsePoint` methods all contain similar logic for extracting fields from objects or parsing JSON, which suggests potential repetition in other similar classes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The methods `parseFont`, `parseColor`, `parseRectangle`, and `parsePoint` have very similar logic for parsing JSON fields, with minor variations for the specific fields they handle.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods frequently interact with `JSONLexer` and `DefaultJSONParser`, in ways that suggest changes to these classes or the JSON parsing process might require parallel changes in each method.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to how JSON fields are parsed or written would likely impact multiple methods. For example, adding a new field to any of the objects would require updating the corresponding `parseXXX` method and likely the `write` method as well.

5. Summary Judgment: The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to repetitive logic in parsing and writing different AWT classes, which would necessitate multiple edits if the underlying parsing or data structure were to change."
OrderController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file does not contain many methods performing similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no obvious duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods do interact with different classes, but there is no strong indication that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely affect specific methods but not in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery. For example, changing the structure of `Order` might impact several parts but is isolated.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
XxlJobInfoDao.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
No, the methods in this file perform distinct operations such as listing, saving, loading, updating, and deleting job information. There are no methods that perform repetitive or similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No, there is no duplication or repeated logic across the methods in this file. Each method has a unique purpose and uses distinct parameters.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The methods interact with the data layer (via database calls presumably) but do not show widespread interactions with many different classes within the file.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If there were changes to the `XxlJobInfo` class or the logic of a specific method's functionality, only that method or methods directly affected by the change would need updating. There are no indications that a small change would cascade into many method updates.

5. Summary Judgment:
This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method is clearly defined for specific tasks and does not exhibit characteristics of Shotgun Surgery."
ConnectionPool.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

### Summary Judgment:
The file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are some repeated patterns and calls to similar methods, these seem to be part of a well-structured and necessary connection management process within a Redis client, rather than indicative of a design that requires widespread changes for small modifications."
LinkedHashMultimap.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are no many methods performing similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method appears to have a distinct purpose related to the functionality of the multimap.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The code does not show patterns of repeated logic across multiple methods. Similar logic related to iteration, hashing, and adding/removing elements is encapsulated within classes and methods logically.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods interact with other classes (e.g., `Set`, `Collection`, `Iterator`, `Map`, `Entry`), but these interactions are typical for implementing multimap behavior and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in a business rule, data structure, or method signature would likely affect only specific methods or classes where the change is relevant. For example, changing how entries are hashed would affect methods related to hashing and possibly the `ValueSet` class but not broadly impact unrelated methods.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods and logic are structured in a way that encapsulates functionality and limits the impact of changes."
PropertyElf.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `getPropertyNames`, `getProperty`, and `setProperty` perform distinct tasks related to property handling, but they are not repetitive or nearly identical.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some duplication in the logic to capitalize property names and invoke methods. For example, in `getProperty` and `setProperty`, similar logic is used to handle method invocation with different prefixes (`get`, `is`, `set`).

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods interact with other classes via reflection, but this is consistent with their intended functionality and does not suggest widespread interaction indicating Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the property handling logic (e.g., adding more type checks in `setProperty`) would impact multiple methods (`setProperty`, potentially `getProperty` and `getPropertyNames`), but these impacts are logical and necessary for maintaining the class's functionality.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are well-structured and perform specific tasks with clear responsibilities."
PendingTransactionsDialog.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- Methods like `createDialogArea` and `loadContexts` perform distinct tasks, and while they are somewhat complex, they are not repetitive.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no significant duplication of logic. Similar logic is used for enabling/disabling buttons, but this is not extensive enough to suggest Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods interact with various classes, but these interactions are specific to the UI and transaction management tasks, typical for a dialog class.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes in business rules related to transaction handling would likely affect methods like `endTransaction` and `loadContexts`, but these changes are localized within those methods and do not suggest widespread changes required across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not exhibit patterns indicative of Shotgun Surgery. Changes to business rules are likely to require targeted changes rather than many small edits scattered throughout the file."
JedisClusterTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

**Summary Judgment:**  
The file contains a variety of test cases for JedisCluster, covering different functionalities and error handling scenarios. While there are repetitive patterns such as initializing and cleaning up Jedis nodes, these are standard practices for test setup and teardown that do not inherently suggest Shotgun Surgery. The methods perform distinct tests and do not indicate a need for widespread changes due to small modifications in requirements."
RandomGenerator.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No repetitive or similar methods found.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No duplicated logic observed.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods interact with only two external classes (`RandomUtil` and `StrUtil`), not in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures would not likely require updating many methods in this file.
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
RouterNanoHTTPD.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains several handler classes (`DefaultStreamHandler`, `DefaultHandler`, `GeneralHandler`, `StaticPageHandler`, `Error404UriHandler`, `IndexHandler`, `NotImplementedHandler`) that implement similar methods but handle different types of responses.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplication of complex logic. Boilerplate code like implementing `UriResponder` interface methods exists, but it is consistent and not complex.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods interact with several other classes (e.g., `UriResource`, `NanoHTTPD`, `IHTTPSession`, `Response`), but this seems to be normal for an HTTP server routing mechanism and not indicative of shotgun surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - If the method signature of `UriResponder` were to change, it would require updates in all implementing classes (e.g., `DefaultHandler`, `StaticPageHandler`), but these changes would be local and not scattered across different functionalities.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there is some boilerplate code and repeated method signatures across different handler classes, these patterns are standard for implementing different kinds of HTTP response handlers and do not indicate that a small change would require many scattered edits across the file."
JavassistProxyFactory.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods `generateProxyClass` and `modifyProxyFactory` are doing similar tasks but are specific to their purpose and interact with different parts of the generation process. There is no strong indication of repetitive tasks within the same method structure.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is a slight duplication with the method body string used in `generateProxyClass` for different interfaces, but it's a template and not extensive duplication. The method body string changes slightly based on whether casting is required.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with various classes (`Connection`, `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, etc.), but the interactions are method-specific and not scattered in a way that multiplying changes would be required.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the generation logic or the method bodies would need updates in a few specific places. However, these changes do not appear to be extensive or widespread within the file itself.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are some repetitive patterns such as generating method bodies for proxy classes, these are localized within the `generateProxyClass` method. Changes in the requirements for method generation or proxy creation would likely be confined to this method or the `modifyProxyFactory` method, rather than requiring changes across many small, similar edits."
ClusterConnectionManager.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

This file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery based on the given analysis. The methods and logic in the file are well-structured, with clear responsibilities, and do not appear to involve repetitive patterns or widely widespread external interactions that would suggest that a small change in requirements would necessitate many related changes. However, without the context of the rest of the codebase, some areas might be indicative of potential issues when viewed in a broader scope."
RequestLimiter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The methods `increment` and `add` are related but not repetitive in a way that indicates Shotgun Surgery.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods.

Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods interact with `LeapArray` and `LongAdder` but not in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

Change Impact Within the File:
- A change in `LeapArray` or `LongAdder` API or the core logic of QPS calculation would affect multiple methods, but this is more about dependency than Shotgun Surgery.

Summary Judgment:
- This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
MockNamingService.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery
Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains many methods that are very similar, differing primarily in the parameters they accept, such as `registerInstance`, `deregisterInstance`, `getAllInstances`, `selectInstances`, `selectOneHealthyInstance`, `subscribe`, and `unsubscribe`.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic: While the logic within each method is currently empty or returning null, the method signatures and parameters are repeated across many methods.

Widespread External Interactions: Each method interacts with parameters that suggest they would need to interact with similar external systems or data structures, which could imply that changes should be propagated to many methods.

Change Impact Within the File: If changes were made to how instances are registered, deregistered, subscribed to, or other operations related to `NamingService`, it would likely require updating many methods in this file due to the high number of similar methods.

Summary Judgment: Based on the high number of similar methods and repetitive patterns in their signatures and parameters, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would likely require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery)."
MethodVisitor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   The methods in the file do not appear to perform repetitive tasks. Each method has a specific role and purpose.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   Methods in this file do not show frequent interactions with many different classes. They primarily interact with simple data types and objects that are part of the ASM framework.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   If a business rule or method signature were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file, as each method has a distinct function.

5. Summary Judgment:
   There are no signs in this file that suggest a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the absence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
FlowControllerV1.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   - Methods like `apiAddFlowRule` and `apiUpdateFlowRule` have similar logic for validating and setting fields in `FlowRuleEntity`.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   - Validation logic for `FlowRuleEntity` fields is repeated in `checkEntityInternal` and parts of `apiUpdateFlowRule`.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   - Methods interact with `SentinelApiClient` for fetching and setting rules of machines, which suggests that changes in the API could require changes in multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   - Changes to the `FlowRuleEntity` fields or validation logic would require updates in multiple methods (`checkEntityInternal`, `apiAddFlowRule`, `apiUpdateFlowRule`).

5. Summary Judgment: 
   - The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to repeated validation logic and interactions with external systems (`SentinelApiClient`). Changes in validation rules or external API interactions would likely require modifications in several places."
DiagnosedStreamCorruptionException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are no repetitive or similar methods in this file.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The logic for generating the diagnostic string in the `toString()` method is not repeated elsewhere in the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file have minimal interaction with external classes. They primarily interact with `HexDump`, `StringWriter`, and `PrintWriter`.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in the data structure or method signature used here (such as the `byte[]` arrays or exceptions) would likely affect only the `toString()` method and the constructor.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the provided file, there are no signs that indicate a small change in requirements would lead to many small edits across multiple places in this file or likely in similar files. The file is relatively focused and does not exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery."
XMLConfigBuilder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains methods that handle different XML elements but they are not repetitive or similar tasks within themselves. Each method is responsible for parsing and configuring a specific aspect of MyBatis.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There are no patterns of duplicated or repeated logic. Each method deals with unique elements and settings.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods frequently interact with different parts of the MyBatis framework to configure settings, register handlers, and set up data sources. However, these interactions are specific to the initialization process and do not indicate Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule or data structure changes, the impact would not necessarily require updating many methods. Each method focuses on specific configurations and would only need changes if its specific area is affected.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as changes typically would affect only the relevant methods rather than necessitating updates in many places. Each method is closely tied to a specific configuration aspect and any changes would be localized within that method or a few related methods."
Lexeme.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar tasks.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no repeated logic across methods.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods primarily interact with the internal fields of the `Lexeme` class and do not indicate widespread external interactions.

   - Changes to certain data structures or method signatures would likely affect multiple methods, but not in a manner indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not exhibit signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
AztecCode.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The file contains getter and setter methods for each field, which are standard and not repetitive in a problematic way.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no duplicated or repeated logic in the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- The methods primarily interact with the fields of the class and do not show signs of interacting with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes to the structure of this class (e.g., adding a new field) would require adding only the new getter and setter methods, not many other changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. It is a straightforward representation of an Aztec 2D code with simple accessors and mutators."
EntryConfig.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains several constructors for the `EntryConfig` class, each with slightly different parameters, but they do not perform repetitive tasks beyond setting the fields of the class.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic within the methods or classes of this file. The constructors all initialize the object fields with the parameters provided, with some constructors filling in default values.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file interact with external classes mainly for validation (`AssertUtil`) and a simple conversion (`Arrays.toString` in `toString()` method). These interactions are straightforward and do not suggest widespread, inter-dependent changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the business rules for `resourceName`, `entryType`, `acquireCount`, or similar fields would only require changes in the constructors or getter methods if the fields themselves changed. There is no evidence that many such changes would be needed across the file.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The constructors are similar only in that they perform a similar action (initializing an object), but there is no indication that a small change would necessitate many edits to the file."
ScriptProcessorBuilder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- Methods `scriptFromFile` and `scriptFromClassPathFile` have similar logic for reading a script from different sources, but they are not repetitive in the context of Shotgun Surgery as they handle different use cases.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- The exception handling and conversion to a runtime exception (IllegalArgumentException) is duplicated between `scriptFromFile` and `scriptFromClassPathFile`. However, this is a common pattern for error handling and does not indicate Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods interact with classes like `FileInputStream`, `InputStream`, and `IOUtils`, but these interactions are specific to loading scripts and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes to script loading mechanisms would impact `scriptFromFile` and `scriptFromClassPathFile`, but isolated to these methods. Changes to other components like `ScriptProcessor` would primarily affect the `build` method.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not exhibit signs that a small change would require many changes across multiple places. The methods are somewhat similar but serve distinct purposes and changes in them are localized."
MapTypeAdapterFactory.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods `getKeyAdapter`, `Adapter.read`, and `Adapter.write` perform distinct tasks. There are no repetitive or similar methods that suggest Shotgun Surgery.

   - There is no duplicated logic across methods. Each method handles its specific responsibility without redundancy.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods do interact with various classes (e.g., `JsonReader`, `JsonWriter`, `TypeAdapter`, `TypeAdapterFactory`), but these interactions are necessary for the functionality and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in certain areas, such as modifying how keys are serialized or adding new types of keys, would affect multiple methods. For example, changes in `keyToString` or key serialization logic in `Adapter.write` would impact multiple places where keys are processed.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are areas where changes might affect multiple methods (e.g., key serialization logic), the overall structure is not indicative of Shotgun Surgery. Each method has a clear, single responsibility, and the duplicated impact is necessary rather than due to lack of abstraction or poor design."
AttributeNameHistoWalker.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains only one specific method `visit`, which is not repetitive or similar to any other methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file primarily interact with the `IMetaMember` interface to retrieve attribute values, but there is no indication of widespread external interactions that would suggest changes needing to be made in many places.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file would not likely require updating many methods. The primary method `visit` could require changes if the interaction with the `IMetaMember` interface's methods like `getCompiledAttribute` or `getQueuedAttribute` changes.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The logic is specific to handling attributes of `IMetaMember` and does not indicate Shotgun Surgery."
PageModelExtractor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are methods like `getAnnotationExtractByUrl`, `getAnnotationExtractCombo`, and `getAnnotationExtractBy` that perform similar tasks, they handle different annotations and have distinct functionalities, not exact repetitions.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some duplication, particularly in how `FieldExtractor` is instantiated and configured in `getAnnotationExtractByUrl`, `getAnnotationExtractCombo`, and `getAnnotationExtractBy`. However, this is necessary given the different processing needed for each type of annotation.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods within this file do interact with multiple different classes and selectors, but this seems to be a necessity for its functionality in extracting data from web pages, rather than a sign of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely affect multiple methods in specific and necessary ways. For example, modifying the handling of annotations could impact `getAnnotationExtractByUrl`, `getAnnotationExtractCombo`, and `getAnnotationExtractBy`.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods have specific responsibilities and the logic is organized to handle different extraction scenarios, making necessary changes more localized rather than proliferating throughout the file."

Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No evident patterns of many methods performing similar tasks are found in this file.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No significant duplicated or repeated logic was identified in this file.

Widespread External Interactions:
The methods interact with various classes, but not in a way that suggests a single change would necessitate many similar changes across methods.

Change Impact Within the File:
While there are several methods and conditions that would need updates if core components like `Downloader`, `Scheduler`, or `Pipeline` were to fundamentally change, the file's modular design and use of interfaces mitigate broad changes.

Summary Judgment:
This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. It is well-structured with clear separations of concerns and uses interfaces to decouple its components."
RandomService.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the methods in the file perform distinct tasks related to generating random values and numbers, without substantial repetition.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, the logic within each method is relatively unique and does not include significant duplication.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, the methods primarily interact with the instance of `Random` and do not involve interactions with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule or method signature were to change, the impact would be minimal and limited. For example, changing the default random generation might affect multiple methods that use `this.random`, but these changes would not be widespread or necessarily numerous.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are relatively independent and changes to one method would not necessitate similar changes in many others."
RuleContainer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are multiple methods, they perform distinct tasks such as adding different types of rules, setting order values, and applying rules. There are no small or repetitive methods forwarding calls or updating similar fields.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The logic within methods is not highly duplicated. The `apply` method has a conditional check based on the rule type but handles them distinctly.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods primarily interact with internal data structures like lists and maps. There is no indication of frequent interaction with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the rule ordering, rule application logic, or data structures would impact multiple methods, but these changes seem to be central to the class's functionality and not scattered across unrelated methods.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the logic and interactions are well-encapsulated within the class."
LocalCacheListener.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods do not appear to perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose, such as adding listeners, clearing cache, and handling updates.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplication of logic across multiple methods. The method `disableKeys` involves looping over data and updating a cache and a map, but this is encapsulated as a single method with specific functionality.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file do interact with many different classes (e.g., `RedissonTopic`, `RListMultimapCache`, `RSemaphore`, etc.), but these interactions are justified by the business logic of the application rather than being a symptom of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to a business rule, data structure, or method signature would likely impact specific methods, but not as widespread. For example, changes to caching logic or listener behavior would primarily affect `createCache` and methods related to listener management (`add`, `remove`).

5. Summary Judgment:
   - There are no clear signs that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits in multiple places. The code is structured with distinct responsibilities and does not exhibit the patterns indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
TransactionMQProducer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are constructor overloads, but they are variations of the same constructor, not similar tasks.
   - `sendMessageInTransaction` methods are similar in functionality but handle different parameters.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - `msg.setTopic(NamespaceUtil.wrapNamespace(this.getNamespace(), msg.getTopic()));` is repeated in both `sendMessageInTransaction` methods.
   - Deprecated setter methods for `checkThreadPoolMinSize`, `checkThreadPoolMaxSize`, and `checkRequestHoldMax` have the same recommended message.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with `DefaultMQProducerImpl` and `NamespaceUtil`, but not in a way that suggests widespread changes required.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to `sendMessageInTransaction` methods or the deprecated methods would require updates in specific places, not many small similar changes across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are some repetitive patterns, such as the repeated logic for setting the topic and the deprecated methods with similar messages, these do not necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery across the codebase."
PlainPermissionManager.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains methods that perform somewhat similar tasks such as interacting with the configuration file to update different sections like `accounts` or `globalWhiteRemoteAddresses`. However, these methods are sufficiently distinct to perform different operations and are not repetitive in nature.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repeated logic, particularly related to reading and writing to the configuration file and updating the data version. However, this repetition is necessary for different operations and does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with external classes such as `AclUtils`, `RemoteAddressStrategyFactory`, and file operations. However, these interactions are specific to their functionality and not overly broad.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the structure of the configuration file or data versioning would require updates in several methods (e.g., adding or removing configuration sections). However, these changes are necessary and are handled through specific methods designed for such purposes.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, while there are some areas where changes might need to be made in multiple places, it does not indicate Shotgun Surgery. The file is structured to handle different operations related to ACL management in a modular way."
JSONTokener.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are multiple methods, they seem to perform distinct tokenizing and parsing tasks rather than repetitive or similar tasks.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplication of logic within the methods.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods primarily interact with their own state and the `Reader` interface. There isn't extensive interaction with many external classes.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely affect specific-related methods rather than many across the file.
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not exhibit signs that a small change would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method has a specific responsibility and interacts with external components, such as `Reader`, minimally and clearly."
AndroidMusic.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some methods that follow a similar pattern (checking if `player` is null and handling exceptions), these methods primarily involve different functionalities such as `play`, `pause`, `stop`, etc.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repetition related to checking if `player` is null and handling exceptions, but the core logic within each method is different.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods primarily interact with the `MediaPlayer` API and occasionally with `Gdx.app` for logging or posting runnables, but these interactions are specific to each method's functionality.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in the `MediaPlayer` API or interactions would affect multiple methods, but these changes would likely involve modifying the specific interactions rather than making many small, similar changes across multiple methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as the methods are focused on distinct functionalities with some common boilerplate (checking for null and handling exceptions), but no widespread similar changes are required for small requirements changes."
WriteWorkbookHolder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - This file contains a few setters and getters, but they are standard for Java beans and do not perform repetitive or similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplication or repetition of logic within the methods or classes in this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods in this file interact with multiple classes (e.g., `Workbook`, `OutputStream`, `File`, etc.), but these interactions are typical for a file handler and do not suggest frequent changes across many places.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in business rules, data structure, or method signatures would likely affect specific methods rather than many. The constructor and the `copyTemplate` method are the most complex, but they handle specific responsibilities without indicating widespread impact.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, the file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The file is structured as a typical holder class with specific logic for handling workbook creation and template copying."
DefaultDateTypeAdapter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are different constructors that add date formats to `dateFormats` list, they are not strictly repetitive but rather serve different purposes by accepting different parameters.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The pattern of adding date formats to the `dateFormats` list in constructors is repeated with slight variations, but this logic is necessary for different configurations. The synchronization pattern around `dateFormats` usage in `write` and `deserializeToDate` methods is also repeated, but it is standard practice for ensuring thread safety of non-thread-safe `DateFormat` objects.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods primarily interact with `JsonWriter`, `JsonReader`, `Date`, `DateFormat`, and custom classes from `Gson`. There are no signs of interacting with a wide array of classes that would indicate Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the date formatting logic or thread-safety handling would affect multiple methods, but these changes are localized to formatting details and synchronization mechanisms, which are inherently related to the core functionality of the class.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as most of the repetition is due to the necessity of handling different configurations and ensuring thread safety, which are part of the core responsibilities of the class."
AckSchedulerKey.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:  
   There are no repetitive or similar methods in this file. Each method has a distinct purpose.

   Changes in this file would not likely require updating many methods. For example, a change in the `index` field would only affect the `getIndex` method, `hashCode`, and `equals` methods.

5. Summary Judgment:  
   This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
TableView.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some methods that handle similar tasks, such as methods dealing with borders and padding, they are not extensive or repetitive enough to suggest Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, particularly around the handling of borders and the calculation of column widths. However, this is managed through utility methods and is not duplicated in many places.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods mostly interact with their own class and utility classes like `StringUtils`. There is no indication of interaction with a wide variety of other classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Impact of changes would be localized to specific methods. For example, a change to how borders are calculated would affect methods dealing with borders directly but not necessarily many unrelated methods.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are areas for potential refactoring to improve readability and reduce code duplication (such as handling border logic), changes to a single feature do not seem to ripple across many unrelated methods."
HttpClientDownloader.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - No obvious repetitive or similar methods found.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - No duplicated or repeated logic across methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file primarily interact with `CloseableHttpClient`, `Request`, `Site`, and other related classes. While they interact with multiple classes, it does not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to `Site`, `Request`, `Page`, or method signatures used in this file would impact methods that use those, but they are contained within logical boundaries (like `download` and `handleResponse` methods) and do not suggest widespread changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. Changes to business rules or data structures within this file would likely target specific methods rather than necessitating many small edits across the file."
CN_QuantifierSegmenter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic across the methods. Each method handles different parts of the analysis process.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods primarily interact with the `AnalyzeContext` and `Dictionary` classes, but these interactions are specific to the logic of each method and do not suggest widespread changes due to a single change in these classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in the `AnalyzeContext` or `Dictionary` classes would impact methods that interact with them, but there is no indication that it would require many small edits across the file or multiple places. Each method is encapsulated and responsible for a specific part of the process.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method has a clear, isolated responsibility, and changes would likely be localized."
CompareObjectsSettings.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** The file contains standard getter and setter methods for its fields, which are typical and not repetitive. There is also a `loadFrom` and `saveTo` method that handle loading and saving settings, but they are not repetitive with respect to each other.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** There is a pattern in the `loadFrom` and `saveTo` methods where each field is individually checked or stored. This is not duplicated logic but necessary for handling each setting separately.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** The methods in this file only interact with the `DBPSettingsSection` class for saving and loading settings. There is no sign of interacting with many different classes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** If a business rule or a data structure used here were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods. Each property has its own getter and setter, and changes would typically be localized.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. It is a straightforward class with clear separation of concerns, handling settings and their persistence."

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplication of logic across multiple methods within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file interact with different classes like `HikariPool`, `HikariConfig`, `HealthCheckRegistry`, `MetricRegistry`, `Timer`, and `Connection`, but these interactions seem necessary for its functionality rather than indicating Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: The file’s methods seem to be isolated in terms of changes. For example, changes to the logic of connectivity checking would only impact the `ConnectivityHealthCheck` class, and changes to the logic involving the 99th percentile check would only impact the `Connection99Percent` class.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, a small change in requirements would not likely require many small edits in multiple places within this file. Each health check method is well-encapsulated and appears focused on a specific responsibility."

There is minimal duplicated logic. Methods like `resolve` and `parseClassPath` are used in multiple places, but these are generic utility methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in the file interact with multiple classes, but often in specific contexts. The interactions seem targeted and specific to the functionality of plugin management.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures in this file would likely require updates in specific methods, not necessarily many methods. For example, changes to how a manifest is parsed would affect `loadLinkedManifest` and `createPluginWrapper`, but not the entire file.

5. Summary Judgment:
This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The tasks are well-separated into methods focused on specific functionalities."
ClientHead.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `send(Packet packet)` and `send(Packet packet, Transport transport)` perform related tasks but with different parameters, indicating a potential area of concern if additional transports or changes to packet handling are needed.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - Logic related to handling channel updates and packet queue management is repeated in several methods such as `bindChannel`, `releasePollingChannel`, and `upgradeCurrentTransport`.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with `Channel`, `TransportState`, `NamespaceClient`, and other external components, but these interactions are generally well-encapsulated within methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in `Transport` handling or `Packet` processing would likely require updates in multiple methods, but the encapsulation of these interactions suggests that such changes could be localized.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are some signs of repeated logic that could complicate changes (e.g., transport handling, packet queue management), the code is generally well-structured to minimize the spread of changes. There is no strong evidence that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits in multiple places."

Tokeniser.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

**Repetitive or Similar Methods:**
No evident repetitive methods that perform similar small tasks are found in this single file.

**Duplicated or Repeated Logic:**
There is some duplicate logic, such as the various `emit` methods that handle different types (String, StringBuilder, char, char[]), but they are variations designed to limit the need to create temporary strings and are distinct enough in their parameters and functionality.

**Widespread External Interactions:**
While the methods interact with multiple classes (e.g., `CharacterReader`, `Token`, `ParseErrorList`), these interactions are primarily centered around specific functionalities like consuming input, building and emitting tokens, and handling errors. There's no pervasive interaction suggesting Shotgun Surgery.

**Change Impact Within the File:**
A change in something like `Token` class structure or `CharacterReader` interface would require adjustments in this file, but there are mechanisms in place (like polymorphism and factory methods) to minimize cascading changes. For instance, the `TokeniserState.read` method abstracts state-specific reading logic, limiting the direct impact of state changes.

**Summary Judgment:**
The file does not exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery, as changes within or external to this file would not likely require numerous small, similar changes across multiple methods."

ResultLoaderMap.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method in `ResultLoaderMap` and `LoadPair` has distinct responsibilities.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic, particularly the conversion to uppercase and the removal of properties from `loaderMap`. However, this repetition is minimal and localized within specific methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in this file interact with several different classes (e.g., `MetaObject`, `ResultLoader`, `MappedStatement`, `Configuration`), but these interactions are necessary for the functionality and not suggestive of widespread, similar changes required across many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
While some changes might require modifications in multiple methods (e.g., changes to `LoadPair` fields or methods), the overall impact within this file does not suggest that a single small change would necessitate many small edits. The design isolates logic effectively.

5. Summary Judgment:
This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is well-structured, with each method handling a specific task, and changes are likely to be localized within specific components."

   - The methods `matchVCardPrefixedField` and `matchSingleVCardPrefixedField` are closely related but not repetitive. They differ in their return types and in how they handle the results.
   
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic for parsing and processing VCard fields is encapsulated in `matchVCardPrefixedField` and reused by `matchSingleVCardPrefixedField`. There is no significant duplication aside from the use of similar pattern matching and string manipulation.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods primarily interact with the `String` class and its methods. There are no frequent interactions with multiple different classes that suggest a wide spread impact from changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the parsing logic or field handling would primarily affect the `matchVCardPrefixedField` and `matchSingleVCardPrefixedField` methods. Other parts of the file are relatively isolated.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are method interactions and some pattern matching, the changes required to adapt to new fields or parsing requirements would be localized and focused on the parsing logic rather than scattered small edits throughout the file."

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There is no clear pattern of repeated logic across multiple methods within this file. Each method generally handles a specific piece of the configuration logic related to writing to an Excel file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: While methods interact with several classes (e.g., `WriteBasicParameter`, `WriteHandler`, `Head`), these interactions are specific to the task of setting up and managing write handlers and do not suggest that changes would ripple through many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Changes in requirements affecting a single business rule, data structure, or method signature would not necessitate updates in many methods within this file. The methods are modular and focused.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, the file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is structured in a way that minimizing impact from changes is a priority, with each method handling a specific aspect of the Excel write process."
TestProxies.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   The methods `testProxyCreation`, `testStatementProxy`, `testStatementExceptions`, and `testOtherExceptions` all set up a `HikariDataSource` with a `HikariConfig` in a very similar manner.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   There is repeated setup logic for `HikariConfig` and `HikariDataSource` in each test method.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   Methods frequently interact with `HikariConfig`, `HikariDataSource`, `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`, and other SQL-related interfaces and classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   If there were a change in the configuration setup or the methods used to obtain the `Connection` and `PreparedStatement`, it would likely require updating the setup logic in each test method.

5. Summary Judgment:
   The file contains methods with similar setup logic, which suggests that a small change in the configuration or connection setup would require changes in multiple places, indicating potential Shotgun Surgery."

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that require small changes in requirements to result in many small edits across multiple places."
BytecodeInstruction.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods in this file are not repetitive or similar. They handle distinct functionalities such as setting/getting fields, adding parameters, checking conditions, and converting the object to a string in different formats.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods. Each method has a unique implementation tailored to its specific task.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods do not frequently interact with a wide variety of external classes in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery would be likely. They mainly interact with internal fields and a few utility classes (e.g., `StringUtil` and `Logger`).

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule or data structure changes, it would not necessarily require updating many methods. Changes would likely be localized to the affected areas, such as modifying parameter handling or adjusting the string formatting logic.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are well-defined, handle specific tasks, and do not exhibit patterns that would make them difficult to maintain or modify due to requirement changes."

   - No significant duplicated logic found. Each method has a distinct role in the process of sending a message.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with various classes for logging, message decoding, and validation, but these interactions are specific and modular.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to business rules, such as message validation logic in `msgContentCheck` or `msgCheck`, would affect only a few methods, not multiple.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. While methods interact with a variety of classes, they are well-organized into distinct functionalities with little duplication, and changes to one method would not necessarily require many changes in others."
StpLogic.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

This file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. While it has many methods that interact with different parts of the application and perform various related tasks, there are no obvious repetitive patterns where a small change would require making many similar changes across multiple methods or classes. The methods are generally well-structured and focused on specific functionalities, such as login, logout, permission checks, etc., and changes to one part of the logic, such as token handling or session management, would not necessitate widespread changes throughout the file."
QueueTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are several test methods, they are focused on testing different functionalities of the `Queue` class and are not performing repetitive small tasks.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, particularly in the way the `Queue` is set up and tested for different scenarios, but this is expected in test cases.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file interact with the `Queue` class, but the interactions are specific to testing and do not suggest a broad impact across many methods.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the `Queue` class that affect its core functionality would require updates to these tests. However, these changes are specific to the methods testing the altered functionality.
5. Summary Judgment: The file shows test cases for the `Queue` class, which are necessary and do not indicate Shotgun Surgery. Changes to the `Queue` class would necessitate changes to the corresponding tests, but these changes are specific to the functionality being tested rather than scattered changes across the file."
DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are methods with similar logic, such as `adjustCompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers` and `adjustIncompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers`, but they are not numerous or repetitive in a way that indicates Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, especially in handling and validating `Codeword` objects in methods like `removeIncorrectCodewords`, `adjustCompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers`, and `adjustIncompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers`, but this is not excessive.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file interact with other classes, such as `Codeword` and `BarcodeMetadata`, but these interactions are focused on specific tasks like setting row numbers and validating metadata, which do not suggest widespread change impacts.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If there were a change in `Codeword` or `BarcodeMetadata` handling, it might affect several methods, but the methods are designed to handle specific responsibilities, and the impact seems more limited and contained rather than requiring extensive, parallel changes.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not display strong indicators of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are focused and do not show excessive repetition or widespread changes required for a single requirement change."
RedissonSessionRepository.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- No many methods are found to perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- Patterns of repeated logic are not apparent. Each method seems to have a unique responsibility.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods do interact with external entities like Redis via `RedissonClient`, but these interactions are logical and encapsulated within the context of session management, and do not indicate Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes in business rules or data structures would typically affect only relevant methods. No evidence that a change in one place would necessitate many similar changes across methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not exhibit patterns indicative of Shotgun Surgery. Each method is relatively self-contained, and changes are unlikely to ripple through many parts of the file in a similar manner."
RelationshipTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains multiple test methods (`anyTest`, `directTest`, `extendedTest`, `inLawTest`, `spouseTest`, `parentTest`, `siblingTest`) that are very similar, each testing a different method of `faker.relationships()` for non-empty, non-null strings.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The core logic in each test method is the same: check if the result of `faker.relationships().METHOD()` is not empty or null.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods primarily interact with the `faker.relationships()` object, and there is no indication of interaction with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If the structure of `faker.relationships()` changes, or if any of the tested methods change their behavior or signature, each corresponding test method in this file would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: While there are repetitive methods and some potential change impact, these tests are typical unit test patterns where such repetition is expected and acceptable. There is no strong indication that Shotgun Surgery is present, as the repetition is isolated to unit tests with a clear structure and purpose."
BaseSwaggerConfig.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods in this file perform different tasks related to Swagger configuration and do not show repetitive or similar behavior.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated logic across methods within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods primarily interact with `SwaggerProperties` and other classes within the Swagger framework in a focused manner, without suggesting widespread interactions that would necessitate similar changes elsewhere.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to `SwaggerProperties`, `Docket` setup, or method signatures would primarily impact the methods directly using them, not many methods throughout the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
MapperBuilderAssistant.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are some methods with similar patterns such as `buildParameterMapping` and `buildResultMapping` which both involve resolving types and building mappings, but they are distinct enough to serve their specific purposes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are repeated patterns in how namespaces are applied and handled across multiple methods (`applyCurrentNamespace` is called in many methods).

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file do interact with various classes such as `Cache`, `MappedStatement`, `ParameterMap`, etc., but these interactions are encapsulated within the methods and follow a consistent pattern rather than indicating Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the structure or business rules related to parameter mappings, result mappings, or statement creation might propagate to several methods, but these changes are focused on the mapping classes and builder patterns, and the impact is manageable within the consistent design.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are repeated patterns and interactions with multiple classes, the file does not exhibit the specific issues indicative of Shotgun Surgery. The codebase appears to be well-structured with builder patterns and method reuse where appropriate, which helps mitigate the need for widespread changes when requirements change."
BuildCommand.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are no repetitive or similar methods in this file. The `run` method is extensive but not repetitive.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic in the file. Each method or section of the code performs distinct tasks.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The `run` method interacts with multiple classes and objects, but these interactions are necessary for performing the task of building a job. This is normal external interaction rather than shotgun surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - If a business rule or method signature used in this file were to change, specific methods would need updating, but not many similar changes would be required. Changes would be targeted.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is well-structured, and changes would likely be localized rather than affecting many small, similar changes."
FrameworkField.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

- **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** The methods in this file perform distinct tasks related to a `Field` object and its metadata, such as retrieving its name, annotations, type, and value. There are no repetitive or similar methods.
  
- **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** There is no duplicated or repeated logic across the methods. Each method handles a specific aspect of the `Field` object.

- **Widespread External Interactions:** The methods primarily interact with the `Field` class from the `java.lang.reflect` package. There is no evidence of widespread interaction with many other classes that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

- **Change Impact Within the File:** Changes to the `Field` class or the way fields are accessed would likely require updates to the methods that interact with `Field`, but this impact is limited to the methods that directly use the `Field` API.

- **Summary Judgment:** This file does not show signs indicative of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are focused, perform specific tasks, and do not suggest that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
CmsSubjectCategoryExample.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `andIdIsNull()`, `andNameIsNotNull()`, `andIconEqualTo(String value)`, etc., which all forward calls to `addCriterion()` with different parameters.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   There is repeated logic in the various `andXXX` methods within the `GeneratedCriteria` class that call `addCriterion()` with different SQL conditions and parameters.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   Methods in this file do not show widespread interactions with many different classes. They primarily interact with the classes defined within the file itself, namely `Criteria` and `Criterion`.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   A change in the `addCriterion()` method's signature or the way criteria are constructed would require changes in all `andXXX` methods. However, this change would typically be mechanical and consistent across all occurrences.

5. Summary Judgment:
   While there is repetitive and similar logic repeated across many methods, the impact of changes is localized and consistent, rather than requiring diverse and scattered edits across many different places in the codebase."
GsonBuilder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods in this file are generally performing distinct configuration tasks for building a `Gson` instance, such as setting serialization options and registering type adapters. There is no evidence of repetitive or similar methods performing the same small task across the file.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The file does not exhibit repeated logic. There are some method calls that look somewhat similar, such as those related to setting and registering type adapters, but these are methodical and necessary for the builder pattern functionality. The actual logic within these methods is different to cover the various configuration options.

3. Widespread External Interactions: While methods do interact with many different types (`Excluder`, `FieldNamingStrategy`, `TypeAdapterFactory`, etc.), these interactions are consistent with the builder pattern and are not indicative of Shotgun Surgery. They are necessary for constructing a `Gson` instance with the desired configuration.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature were to change, the impact within this file would likely be localized to the methods directly affected by the change. The builder pattern is designed to isolate such changes. For example, changing the `Excluder` behavior would affect the methods that configure it, but not indiscriminately across the file.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the above analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are clearly delineated, each serving a specific configuration purpose, and changes would likely be confined to specific methods rather than necessitating widespread edits."
RedissonBloomFilter.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

### Summary of Evidence:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: `add(T object)` and `contains(T object)` methods follow a very similar pattern, both interacting with the `CommandBatchService`, checking configuration, and handling exceptions related to configuration changes.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: The logic for interacting with `CommandBatchService` and checking configuration is repeated in `add(T object)` and `contains(T object)` methods. Additionally, the exception handling pattern for detecting configuration changes is repeated across multiple methods, such as `add(T object)`, `tryInit(long expectedInsertions, double falseProbability)`, and `count()`.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Multiple methods interact with `CommandBatchService` and perform similar operations like configuration checking, executing commands, and dealing with response results.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Changes related to configuration handling or command execution patterns (e.g., addition of new configuration parameters or changes in how commands are executed) would likely require updating many methods in this file.

5. **Summary Judgment**: This file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to the repeated patterns of configuration checks and exception handling, widespread interaction with `CommandBatchService`, and the potential need for multiple updates if changes are required in the command execution or configuration handling logic."
InvokeCountOperation.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - No methods in this file perform repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with a few classes (BytecodeInstruction, MemberBytecode, Opcode, ParseUtil) but not in a way that indicates widespread similar changes would be required.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - If a business rule or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not necessarily require updating many methods. The primary method (`processInstructions`) would need changes if the method signature of `BytecodeInstruction` or `MemberBytecode` changes, but the impact is localized.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The operations are clearly defined and scoped to their tasks."
AbstractSentinelAspectSupport.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

This file does not exhibit clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are several methods that deal with similar operations such as handling exceptions or finding methods, these methods are generally well-defined and focused on specific tasks. They also show signs of code reuse and modularity, as seen in methods like `findMethod` and `makeAccessible`. The file does not indicate that a small change in requirements would necessitate numerous small edits in multiple places. Changes to individual methods or logic flows could be contained within those specific methods without requiring widespread changes to other unrelated parts of the file."
SaTokenConfig.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

This file primarily consists of a configuration class with numerous getter and setter methods for different configuration parameters. While there are many methods, they are all standard boilerplate code for accessing and modifying the fields of the `SaTokenConfig` class. There is no evidence of repetitive or similar methods that suggest Shotgun Surgery. The file does not show duplicated or repeated logic across methods that would be affected by a change in requirements. The methods are not interacting with a wide array of external classes in a way that would imply Shotgun Surgery. A change to a business rule or structure would likely only impact the relevant method or fields, not require changes in many methods throughout the file. Therefore, this file does not indicate signs of Shotgun Surgery."
HelpCommand.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- There are no many methods that perform similar tasks. Each method has a distinct responsibility such as creating command models, handling completion, and processing commands.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no clear duplication of logic across the file. Each method handles its part of the command processing and model creation without repeating code unnecessarily.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- The file interacts with several classes (`Command`, `CLI`, `Option`, `Argument`, `Session`, etc.), but these interactions are specific to the responsibilities of each method and does not suggest that changes would ripple across many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- A change in a business rule, for example, adding a new field to `CommandVO`, would require updates in `createCommandVO` method and potentially other methods such as `createHelpDetailModel` and `createHelpModel` that use `CommandVO`. However, these are localized changes and do not imply Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
- Based on the analysis, the file does not show signs that a small change would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are well-defined and changes would typically be localized to specific methods rather than impacting a wide range of methods."
UrlConnectionClient.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the methods in this file have distinct responsibilities such as opening a connection, preparing a request, reading a response, and handling a specific input type. They are not repetitive or similar in their tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, the logic within each method is specific to its functionality, and there is no duplicated logic across methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with external classes primarily through the `HttpURLConnection` class and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes impacting connectivity timeouts, request setup, or response parsing would affect specific methods, but not in a way that indicates Shotgun Surgery. For example, changing the timeout settings would only impact the `openConnection` method.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, the file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating no Shotgun Surgery."
AssemblyProcessor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No obvious patterns of repetitive or similar methods performing small tasks.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No discernible duplicated or repeated logic across methods.
3. Widespread External Interactions: While the class interacts with other classes, there are no signs of widespread interactions that suggest Shotgun Surgery.
4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in business rules or method signatures would likely not require many edits across the file. Changes in parsing logic or assembly methods might affect multiple places but are centralized in their handling.
5. Summary Judgment: The file does not exhibit clear signs of Shotgun Surgery; changes seem to be localized and manageable."
JavaBeanDeserializer.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The `deserialze` method is overloaded multiple times, performing similar tasks with slight variations in parameters.
   - Multiple `parseField` methods exist, with similar logic but varying parameters and additional logic based on these parameters.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The way field deserializers are obtained and used is repeated across different methods (`parseField`, `deserialze`, `deserialzeArrayMapping`, `getFieldDeserializer`).
   - The logic to check for and handle token types (e.g., JSONToken.LBRACE, JSONToken.RBRACE) is repeated in several methods.
   
3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with various lexer and parser methods (e.g., `lexer.nextToken`, `lexer.scanFieldString`) in a way that suggests changes to these methods would impact many deserialization methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in how dates are parsed (e.g., changing the date format) or how specific types are handled would require updates in multiple places within this file.
   - Changes to the token handling logic or field deserialization logic would propagate to multiple methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The presence of numerous similar methods with repeated logic and the widespread interactions with parser/lexer components indicate that a small change in requirements would likely necessitate many small edits across many methods in this file."
RetrofitError.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods `networkError`, `conversionError`, `httpError`, and `unexpectedError` are factory methods for creating instances of `RetrofitError` with different parameters. They are not repetitive or similar in terms of functionality but are necessary for different error scenarios.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplication of logic across methods. Each method constructs a `RetrofitError` instance with specific details relevant to the type of error.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with external classes such as `IOException`, `Converter`, `Response`, and `Type`, but these interactions are specific to the functionality of the error handling and do not suggest widespread changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to fields like `url`, `response`, or `converter` would affect multiple methods accessing these fields, but these changes would be localized and not widespread. Similarly, changes to the `Converter` interface or `Response` class would affect the methods that use them, but these changes would not require extensive modifications across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are multiple methods for creating different types of errors, they are methodically organized and do not suggest that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
Selectable.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are methods like `$(String selector, String attrName)` and `css(String selector, String attrName)` that perform similar tasks, but they are not extensive or numerous enough to suggest Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are duplicated or nearly duplicated methods, such as `$(String selector)` and `css(String selector)`. However, these duplications are limited and do not suggest widespread duplication across the codebase.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods primarily interact with internal logic related to selection and extraction, not with multiple external classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the logic of one method, like `regex`, would not necessarily require changes to other methods. However, if the data structure of `Selectable` or business rules like selection algorithms are changed, it might affect multiple methods, but this is not immediate or immediate-like Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not exhibit clear symptoms of Shotgun Surgery. While there are a few patterns of duplicated or similar methods, the overall structure does not suggest that changes in requirements would necessitate many small edits across many places."
CellFormulaTagHandler.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods `startElement`, `endElement`, and `characters` do not perform similar or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic across the methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with `XlsxReadContext` and `XlsxReadSheetHolder`, but not in a widespread manner that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures used here would likely impact only the specific method(s) where they are used, rather than many methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - There are no indications that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places within this file."
ClassWriter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some methods that perform similar tasks (e.g., `newFieldItem`, `newMethodItem`, `newString`), they are focused on managing different types of items in the constant pool and are not performing identical operations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic in the methods that add items to the constant pool, such as the pattern of checking if an item exists and adding it if it doesn't. However, this is necessary given the functionality of the class.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file primarily interact with a few related structures like `ByteVector` and `Item`, and these interactions are not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While there are multiple methods that interact with the constant pool, changes to the structure of items or the constant pool management logic would primarily affect these methods. However, these changes do not seem to necessitate a large number of similar changes elsewhere in the file.

5. Summary Judgment: The file appears to be well-structured for its purpose, with methods that are specific to their tasks and interactions that are limited in scope. There is no evidence that a small change would require many small edits in multiple places."
CompareToBuilder.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Many methods like `append(long lhs, long rhs)`, `append(int lhs, int rhs)`, `append(short lhs, short rhs)`, `append(char lhs, char rhs)`, `append(byte lhs, byte rhs)`, `append(double lhs, double rhs)`, `append(float lhs, float rhs)`, `append(boolean lhs, boolean rhs)` perform very similar tasks.
   - Methods like `append(long[] lhs, long[] rhs)`, `append(int[] lhs, int[] rhs)`, and others follow a similar pattern for comparing arrays of different types.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic for comparing arrays (checking for null, comparing lengths, and then comparing elements) is repeated in each array type method.
   - The logic for comparing primitive types also shares a common pattern, which is repeated across several methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods such as `append(Object lhs, Object rhs)`, `reflectionCompare(Object lhs, Object rhs)`, and their variants interact with different types, which if structured differently in the future, would require modifications in these methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the logic for comparing arrays or primitive types would require modifications in multiple methods (e.g., adding a new logic for handling a new type of array or changing null handling logic).
   - Changes in the logic for checking accessible fields and comparing them via reflection would affect the `reflectionAppend` method and all `reflectionCompare` methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to the repetitive code for comparing different types and arrays, duplicated logic across similar methods, and the need for widespread changes if the comparison logic changes."
DataFormatter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are no obvious repetitive or similar methods that perform small, similar, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic for parsing and formatting dates and numbers is not duplicated or repeated; it is centralized but quite complex.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods interact with several classes, but there is no indication that changes in one place would require similar changes across many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - While changes to the logic for handling specific formats could affect multiple methods, the structure of the class seems to already account for such changes through method abstraction.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is structured to handle various formats through different methods and classes, minimizing the necessity for widespread changes."
AccessTokenModel.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are two similar methods: `getExpiresIn()` and `getRefreshExpiresIn()`, but they perform different tasks related to different tokens.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplicated logic. The methods are distinct and handle different tasks.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods primarily interact with the class's fields and do not suggest interactions with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changing the calculation method for token expiration or the way attributes are mapped to a `Map` would affect `getExpiresIn()`, `getRefreshExpiresIn()`, and `toLineMap()` respectively. However, these changes are limited to specific methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, there are no signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
NiceSecurePasswordField.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `capsLockedIcon.visibleProperty().bind` and `capsLockedIcon.managedProperty().bind` are repeated for different icons, but these patterns are specific to UI component bindings and don't indicate widespread repetition.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repetition in the icon setup, particularly in the binding of visible and managed properties, but this is limited to UI component configuration.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with several JavaFX classes (e.g., `ToggleButton`, `FontAwesome5IconView`), but these interactions are specific to constructing and managing a UI component and do not suggest widespread interactions leading to Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the underlying `SecurePasswordField` or UI library would require adjustments, but these would likely be contained within the methods that construct and manage the UI components.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are some repetitive patterns in setting up UI components, the file does not exhibit signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places across the codebase. The repetition is localized to UI configuration and does not indicate Shotgun Surgery."
GeometryViewerRegistry.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   There do not appear to be many methods that perform similar, small or repetitive tasks. Each method in the file has a distinct responsibility within the context of managing geometry viewers and leaflet tiles.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   There is some repeated logic, particularly around the use of synchronized blocks for thread safety when accessing or modifying collections of predefined and user-defined tiles. However, this repetition is necessary for maintaining consistent behavior across different methods and does not seem excessive.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   Methods do interact with various classes such as `IConfigurationElement`, `LeafletTilesDescriptor`, and others, but these interactions are necessary for the functionality of the registry. There does not appear to be an unusually wide range of class interactions suggestive of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   While there are several methods that interact with the tiles collection that could be affected by changes in their structure (e.g., `getPredefinedLeafletTiles`, `getUserDefinedLeafletTiles`, `setDefaultLeafletTilesNonSynchronized`), these changes would likely be localized to how collections are handled or accessed rather than requiring many small changes across the file.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are cohesive, and changes to data structures or business rules would likely be confined to specific, well-defined sections of the code."
RestMethodInfoTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

- **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** While there are many similar test methods that verify different aspects of the `RestMethodInfo` class, these methods are not performing repetitive tasks but rather are testing different edge cases and scenarios to ensure robustness.

- **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** There is no duplicated logic observed across methods. Each test is checking specific behaviors or validation errors.

- **Widespread External Interactions:** Methods in this file primarily interact with the `RestMethodInfo` class and its related classes for testing purposes. There are no indications of widespread interactions with many different classes for the same changes.

- **Change Impact Within the File:** Changes to `RestMethodInfo` or its annotations would likely only affect the assertions within these test methods that directly depend on those specific behaviors.

- **Summary Judgment:** This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as the tests are structured to handle specific, isolated cases rather than requiring many small edits for a single change in requirements."
AssertUtil.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- `assertByteArrayListEquals` and `assertByteArraySetEquals` both perform similar tasks of comparing collections of `byte[]` arrays.
- `assertCollectionContainsAll` and `assertByteArrayCollectionContainsAll` have similar logic for checking if one collection contains all elements of another, with the only difference being the type of elements.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- The logic for checking element equality and presence in collections (`for` loops and `if` statements using `Arrays.equals` or `Objects.equals`) is repeated across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods interact with collections and arrays, which are common data structures. Changes in how these structures are handled or compared might require changes across these methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- If the method of comparison (e.g., from `Arrays.equals` to another method) were to change, it would require updating multiple methods (`assertByteArrayListEquals`, `assertByteArraySetEquals`, `assertByteArrayCollectionContainsAll`).
- If the error handling or exception thrown (`ComparisonFailure`) were to change, it would also require updates in multiple methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to repetitive logic for comparing collections and arrays, which would likely require changes across multiple methods in the file if the underlying comparison logic or error handling were to change."
FieldAttributes.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The methods in this file perform distinct tasks related to retrieving various attributes or checking conditions of a `Field` object. There are no methods performing repetitive or similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods in this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in this file primarily interact with the `Field` class from the Java Reflection API and do not suggest a change in one place requiring similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Changes in the underlying data structure or certain method signatures (e.g., `Field` class) might require updates in all methods, but the file itself is not structured in a way that indicates Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method is encapsulated and focused on a specific task."
ExcelWriteFillExecutor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some methods that share similar logic or purpose (e.g., `createRowIfNecessary` and `createCellIfNecessary`), there is no extensive repetition of very similar methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There are patterns of similar logic, especially in methods like `getOneCell` and `doFill`, but they are not overwhelmingly duplicated.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with various classes such as `Sheet`, `Row`, `Cell`, and `AnalysisCell`, but these interactions do not seem to suggest that changes in one place would require changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: The methods are generally well-structured around specific tasks; changes to business rules (e.g., how cells are filled or how collections are handled) would likely affect specific methods rather than requiring changes throughout the file.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The structure and logic are organized in a way that isolates changes to specific functionalities."
Throwables.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - No strong evidence of repetitive or similar methods. Each method appears to perform distinct tasks related to handling and manipulating `Throwable` objects.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - Some methods use similar constructs for handling `IOException` and formatting stack traces, but this is not extensive and does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with several external classes (`Throwable`, `Writer`, `List`, etc.), but these interactions are common and not spread across multiple similar methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to `Throwable` handling or stack trace formatting would impact several methods, but these changes are logically grouped (e.g., formatting stack traces, handling suppressed exceptions) and not distributed unnecessarily across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not exhibit signs that small changes in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method has a clear purpose, and changes are localized to where they are logically relevant."
BeanCopier.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains methods like `beanToBean`, `mapToBean`, `mapToMap`, and `beanToMap` that perform different types of copying operations, but they are not repetitive. Each method handles a different scenario and uses distinct logic where appropriate.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
While there are some similar patterns in the methods, such as checking properties for ignore, using `CopyOptions`, and handling null/empty values, the logic is not duplicated. Each method adapts this general approach to its specific needs.

Widespread External Interactions:
The methods interact with other classes like `BeanUtil`, `MapValueProvider`, and `BeanValueProvider` to perform their tasks, but this interaction is consistent with the class's purpose and does not imply Shotgun Surgery.

Change Impact Within the File:
A change in requirements, such as adding a new type of source data or modifying the copy behavior, would not necessarily require changes in many methods. Each method is designed to handle specific cases and can be updated independently if needed.

Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. Each method has a distinct responsibility and while there is some shared logic, it is handleable through common patterns and does not suggest that changes would ripple throughout the file with many small edits."
AndroidGraphics.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are no obvious repetitive methods that perform very similar tasks. Each method has a distinct responsibility in managing OpenGL and graphics state.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant duplicated logic in the methods. However, there are some repeated operations such as logging of managed caches and invalidating all graphics assets which could suggest a pattern.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with various OpenGL classes and Android framework classes, but not in a manner that suggests a change in one would necessitate similar changes elsewhere.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures would not likely require numerous method updates. For example, adding a new field in a method would generally only affect that method or related methods closely tied to that field.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - There are no strong indicators within this file that a small change in requirements would lead to many small edits in multiple places. The methods and logic are fairly modular and isolated."
ExecutorRouteBusyover.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains only one method, so there are no repetitive or similar methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic within the single method.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The method interacts with external classes (`ExecutorBiz`, `XxlJobScheduler`, `I18nUtil`), but not in a widespread way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating this single method rather than many methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, there are no signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
IncompleteElementException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains constructor overloads for `IncompleteElementException` which are typical and not indicative of shotgun surgery on their own.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic within the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods do not interact with many different classes; they merely forward calls to the superclass constructor.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in the `BuilderException` constructor signatures would require updating all the constructors in `IncompleteElementException`. However, this is not due to similar small tasks but due to maintaining constructor signatures, which is a common pattern and not indicative of shotgun surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
NioClientTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No repetitive or similar methods are present in this file.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No duplicated or repeated logic is found across the methods in this file.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file do interact with several external classes (NioClient, ByteBuffer, BufferUtil, StrUtil, Console, Scanner), but not in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in the logic of handling incoming data, writing data, or user input would primarily impact the current method and not many others in this file.
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not display signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
ClientHandler.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains a few methods (`close()` and `run()`), but they are not repetitive or similar in functionality.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with external classes like `NanoHTTPD`, `HTTPSession`, `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Socket`, and `ITempFileManager`, but not in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to methods like `execute()` of `HTTPSession` or the creation pattern of `ITempFileManager` would impact this file, but the changes are localized.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are not repetitive, the logic is not duplicated, and changes to external components would not necessarily propagate into numerous changes within this file."
DefaultJedisSocketFactory.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar tasks. Methods handle specific functionalities such as creating sockets, updating host and port, and getting various configuration details.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods mainly interact with standard Java I/O and networking classes and a few Redis-specific classes. The interactions do not suggest changes in one place requiring similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule or method signature were to change, it would likely not require many updates in this file. Some methods are deprecated, indicating they might be removed in future versions, but their presence does not suggest widespread changes due to small requirements changes.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating no Shotgun Surgery."
CronExpression.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

While this file is quite extensive and complex, it does not exhibit clear signs of Shotgun Surgery based on the given criteria. There are no repetitive methods performing similar tasks, no duplicated or repeated logic across methods, and the interactions with external classes seem focused and not overly widespread. Changes in the business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely require updates, but these are isolated to specific parts of the file and do not indicate the need for small changes in many similar places throughout the codebase."
PooledDataSource.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are many setter methods that perform similar tasks by updating fields and then calling `forceCloseAll()`, this is a common pattern in data source configuration and does not necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic across methods that suggests Shotgun Surgery. Each method typically performs a single, distinct task.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods interact with `UnpooledDataSource`, `Connection`, and SQL-related classes, but these interactions are specific to managing the connection pool and do not suggest widespread, similar interactions indicating Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the connection management logic or data structure would impact multiple methods, but this is typical for a connection pool implementation and does not necessarily signify Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods and logic are well-structured and specific to their tasks, without indicating a need for widespread similar changes across many methods or classes."
EmbedServer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file does not show repetitive methods that perform similar tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose such as starting/stopping the server, handling HTTP requests, and registry operations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with external classes (e.g., `ExecutorBiz`, `NioEventLoopGroup`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`), but these interactions do not suggest widespread changes required across multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in `ExecutorBiz` or business rules would primarily affect `EmbedHttpServerHandler.process()` and `start()`/`stop()` methods, but not in a way that would lead to many small edits across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. It has modular and clear responsibilities within its methods."
SentinelDubboConsumerFilter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains methods that perform similar tasks, such as `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke`, which both handle the invocation and exception tracing for synchronous and asynchronous calls respectively.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, especially in exception handling and cleanup code (entry exit) between `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke`.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file interact with several external classes and methods, but these interactions seem to be part of the intended functionality for integrating with Dubbo and Sentinel, rather than indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to methods like `getMethodName`, `getInterfaceName`, or exception handling could impact multiple places in the file, but these areas seem to follow a pattern and could be easily maintained or extended.

5. Summary Judgment: While there are some repetitive patterns and duplicated logic, particularly in exception handling and entry exit, the file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The repetition appears to be part of the necessary separation of concern between synchronous and asynchronous processing."
QueryParser.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are several methods that handle specific conditions or build specific types of Evaluator objects, they are well-defined and specific to the type of query or selector they are parsing. There is no repetition or similarity in the sense that would indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The logic within different methods is not redundantly duplicated. Each method handles distinct parsing or evaluation tasks related to CSS selectors.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods primarily interact with the internal `TokenQueue` and `Evaluator` classes. There is no indication that changes in one part would require similar changes in many unrelated methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While some changes could impact multiple methods (especially those that involve adding new query conditions or evaluators), the structure of the file and the clear separation of concerns suggest that changes would be localized rather than widespread.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are clearly delineated, handle specific parsing tasks, and any changes in requirements would likely be isolated to the methods involved in those specific tasks."
HikariDataSource.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Most methods are unique in their functionality.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   There is some repeated logic, such as checking if the pool is null before performing operations or throwing exceptions when the DataSource is closed, but this is minimal and necessary for proper resource management.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   Methods in this file frequently interact with the `HikariPool` class and occasionally with the `DataSource` interface, but these are necessary for its function and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   If a business rule or data structure used in this file were to change, it would not necessarily require updating many methods in this file. The configuration sealing and logging mechanisms help manage changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
   This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The structure and encapsulation of the class minimizes the impact of changes."
Excluder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method focuses on a specific functionality or configuration of the exclusion rules.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplication of logic. While there are some methods that check similar properties like version, modifier, and annotations, they are distinct enough in their context and do not suggest repeated logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file interact with a variety of classes and annotations, such as `Field`, `ExclusionStrategy`, `Expose`, `Since`, and `Until`. However, these interactions are specific to the tasks they perform and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods across the file.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule changes, such as how version checks are handled, it would likely require updating a limited number of methods (those directly related to version checks) and not many methods across the file.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are structured to handle specific tasks, and their responsibilities are clearly defined, reducing the likelihood of Shotgun Surgery."
JedisClusterCommand.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are methods that perform similar actions, such as `run(String key)` and `runBinary(byte[] key)`, but they are not repetitive in a way that indicates Shotgun Surgery. They differ in the type of key they accept.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, such as the slot validation for multiple keys in both `run(int keyCount, String... keys)` and `runBinary(int keyCount, byte[]... keys)`, but it is contained and not widespread.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file do interact with other classes, such as `Jedis`, `JedisRedirectionException`, and `JedisClusterConnectionHandler`, but not in a pattern that suggests Shotgun Surgery.
4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in how connections are handled, retries are managed, or how slots are determined could impact multiple methods, but the code is structured to encapsulate such logic within a few methods (`runWithRetries`, `handleConnectionProblem`, etc.), which limits the changes needed.
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. Changes to the core logic of command dispatching, connection handling, or retries would primarily impact a few key methods rather than requiring numerous small changes across the file."
TestConnections.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

### Summary Judgment:
The provided file contains multiple test methods, each performing a different aspect of testing for the HikariCP connection pool. While there is some configuration setup that is repeated, it is context-specific and isolated to individual tests. The overall structure does not suggest that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits across multiple places in this file. Each test method is clear in its purpose and isolated in its operations, which does not indicate the Shotgun Surgery smell."
OmsReceiverInfoParam.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains many getter methods that are repeated for each field, but they are typical getter implementations and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery by themselves.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic across the methods.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file do not interact with other classes; they are simple property getters.
4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in the data structure (e.g., removing a field) would require updating the corresponding getter method, but this does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.
5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are simple getters and do not exhibit the pattern of Shotgun Surgery."
ResizeController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `resizeTopLeft`, `resizeTopRight`, `resizeBottomLeft`, `resizeBottomRight` are similar, delegating part of their work to `resizeTop`, `resizeLeft`, `resizeBottom`, `resizeRight`.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - No direct duplication of logic was found, but similar operations like setting window dimensions and positions are repeated.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with several external classes (`Stage`, `Settings`, `Screen`), but the interactions seem coherent to the resizing functionality.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to window resizing logic or settings interactions would require updates to multiple methods, but this seems to be within a specific functional domain (resizing and settings).

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are some repetitive patterns, these do not strongly indicate Shotgun Surgery. The methods are within a single functionality module, and the repetitions are logical due to the nature of the task."
Lifecycle.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are no methods that perform extremely similar small tasks. Methods like `getHudsonWar`, `rewriteHudsonWar`, `canRewriteHudsonWar`, `restart`, and `verifyRestartable` all have distinct functionalities.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - No significant duplicated logic is observed across different methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with several different classes (`SystemProperties`, `Functions`, `Jenkins`, `FileUtils`, `UnixLifecycle`, `SolarisSMFLifecycle`), but not extensively in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in a business rule or data structure would not likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, changes in the restart mechanism or lifecycle management would affect specific methods, but the rest of the file would likely remain unchanged.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The file is well-structured with clear methods and no evident duplication or repetitive patterns that would indicate Shotgun Surgery."
MarkdownWebServerPlugin.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, there are no repetitive or similar methods that perform small or repetitive tasks.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no duplicated or repeated logic in the methods.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file primarily interact with a few classes (`File`, `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `PegDownProcessor`, `Response`) and do not show a pattern of interacting with many different classes in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.
4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file.
5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
EsProductServiceImpl.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains methods that perform different operations such as import, delete, create, search, and recommend products. There are no many methods that look similar or repetitive.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - Similar logic for creating a `Pageable` object is present in multiple methods (`importAll`, `search`, `recommend`).
   - Similar logic for building `NativeSearchQueryBuilder` and setting up aggregations in `search` and `searchRelatedInfo`.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with `EsProductDao`, `EsProductRepository`, and `ElasticsearchRestTemplate`, but not in a way that suggests a single change would propagate widely.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in the way `Pageable` is created or in the way search queries are built could impact multiple methods, but this seems more about shared functionality rather than shotgun surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there is some duplication in creating `Pageable` and setting up search queries, this does not necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery. The duplicated logic can be abstracted into helper methods to reduce potential impacts of future changes."
ProjectExportWizard.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains methods that perform related tasks, such as exporting projects and resources, but they do not appear to be identical or nearly identical. Each method has its specific responsibility, such as exporting individual projects, iterating through resources, or exporting drivers.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No significant duplicated or repeated logic was found across methods. The logic remains distinctively specific to tasks such as adding elements to XML, handling resources, and processing streams.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with various resources, such as files, streams, and project components, but these interactions are encapsulated within specific methods rather than being scattered across methods in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in requirements, such as a modification to how project or resource metadata is collected or exported, would likely affect specific methods directly concerned with those tasks. However, there isn't an indication that a single change would necessitate numerous small changes across the file.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not exhibit strong indicators of Shotgun Surgery. It has well-defined methods with specific responsibilities, and changes in one part of the file are unlikely to necessitate many small updates in multiple places."
SentinelApacheHttpClientConfig.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains getter and setter methods, but they are straightforward and not repetitive or similar in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic in the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The file interacts with a few external classes (`AssertUtil`, `ApacheHttpClientResourceExtractor`, `DefaultApacheHttpClientResourceExtractor`, `ApacheHttpClientFallback`, `DefaultApacheHttpClientFallback`), but not in a widespread manner.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in `prefix`, `extractor`, or `fallback` would only affect their respective getter and setter methods or the classes they use.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as it is a simple configuration class with straightforward methods."
CachingExecutor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are no obvious repetitive or similar methods in this file. Each method seems to have a distinct role or operation, even though they often delegate to methods of the `delegate` object.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The logic is not duplicated across methods. Each method generally performs unique tasks, with some methods delegating similar-looking calls to the `delegate`.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with various classes (`MappedStatement`, `BoundSql`, `Cache`, `Transaction`, etc.), but the interactions are not in a way that suggests many small, similar changes would be required across them.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in `delegate` methods or their signatures could require updates in multiple methods in this file, but these changes would be related to the delegate's contract rather than repetitive logic. For example, if `delegate.query` were to change, every method that calls it might need to adapt.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are many delegating methods, they do not exhibit the characteristics of Shotgun Surgery as they are not repetitive or small underpinned by similar changes across the file. The forwarding nature is consistent and does not indicate widespread scattered changes would be required for small requirement changes."
RedisPriorityScheduler.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are no many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no pattern where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file frequently interact with the Redis database via Jedis, but not in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.
4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might not require updating many methods. Changes would likely be localized. For example, changing how priority is calculated would primarily affect `pushWhenNoDuplicate` and `getRequest`.
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
EnablePluginCommand.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file interact with a few external classes, but not in a way that suggests a change in one would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in business rules affecting plugin management, permission checks, or command-line arguments would require updates, but these are not currently widespread or repetitive.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
PoolStats.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The file contains multiple methods (`getTotalConnections`, `getIdleConnections`, `getActiveConnections`, `getPendingThreads`, `getMaxConnections`, `getMinConnections`) that perform similar tasks by checking if data should be loaded and returning a field value.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
The logic to check if data should be loaded (`if (shouldLoad()) { update(); }`) is repeated across these methods, indicating potential Shotgun Surgery.

Widespread External Interactions:
While the methods primarily interact with the fields of the class and a few utility methods, the repeated pattern of checking and updating suggests that a change to this pattern or to the update mechanism could require changes across all these methods.

Change Impact Within the File:
A change to the `shouldLoad` logic or the `update` method would require modifying each of these getter methods, indicating a high impact due to the repetition of the check-update pattern.

Summary Judgment:
Based on the repetitive methods performing similar tasks and the repeated logic for checking and updating data, this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery. A change in the update pattern or loading condition would necessitate changes across multiple getter methods."
MinMaxPriorityQueue.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** The file contains several methods that handle queue operations (e.g., `offer`, `poll`, `peek`) and their variations for the min and max sides of the min-max heap. These methods are not simple or repetitive but are necessary for the functionality of the queue. For example, `pollFirst` and `pollLast` are essentially aliases for `poll` and `removeAndGet(getMaxElementIndex)`, respectively, each serving a distinct interface contract.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** While there is some repeated logic around checking for and handling queue size (e.g., in `bubbleUp` and `crossOverUp`), this logic is encapsulated in small, focused methods such as `bubbleUpAlternatingLevels` and `findMin`. This avoids code duplication and promotes clarity.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** Although the methods interact with various internal components like the heaps (`minHeap` and `maxHeap`), these interactions are specific to the internal structure and operations of the queue and do not suggest a wide or spreading impact from external changes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** Changes to core structures like the comparator or queue capacity would indeed require changes to several methods. However, these changes are likely to be focused around the methods that interact with these structures directly and are not scattered throughout the file.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The evidence does not suggest Shotgun Surgery. The code is well-structured with clear separation between operations on the min-heap and max-heap, and changes are isolated to relevant methods rather than propelling ripple effects throughout the file."
MapDeserializer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains methods like `deserialze` and `parseMap` that are overloaded with slight variations in parameters, but they are not simply forwarding calls or performing repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic, especially around type checking and creation of map instances, but it is encapsulated within methods rather than duplicated across them.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in this file do interact with many different classes (e.g., `JSONLexer`, `ParseContext`, `ParameterizedType`, etc.), but these interactions seem to be related to the parsing and deserialization logic rather than suggesting similar changes across the codebase.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures might impact several methods, especially around type handling and map creation, but the file appears to be well-structured to handle such changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is organized into specific methods with clear responsibilities, and while changes might affect multiple methods, the logic is encapsulated and less likely to cause widespread, similar changes."
ConversionException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains three overloaded constructors for the `ConversionException` class. These methods are repetitive in structure but not in task; they are merely forwarding calls to the superclass constructor with different parameters.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - No, there is no duplicated or repeated logic within the file. Each constructor handles a specific set of parameters and performs a separate, distinct operation.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods in this file interact with the `Exception` superclass. This interaction is standard for exception classes and does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changing the constructor signatures of the `Exception` superclass would require changes in this file, but such changes are unlikely and would not represent Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show any signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. It defines a custom exception class with standard constructor overloading, which is a common practice and does not indicate Shotgun Surgery."

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the file contains two distinct methods with clear different purposes (`beforeCall` and `afterCall`).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no repeated logic in the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Limited to external interactions with `RequestInformation` class, but no sign of widespread interactions.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to `beforeCall` or `afterCall` method signatures would impact the implementing classes, but not within this file itself. There is no indication that a single change would cascade to many similar changes within the file.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as it does not have repetitive methods, duplicated logic, or a structure that suggests changes会影响到 multiple parts requiring similar edits."
ParentRunnerTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The file contains several methods that are similar in that they run tests and verify their behavior (e.g., `useChildHarvester`, `testMultipleFilters`, `failWithHelpfulMessageForProtectedClassRule`). However, these methods are not repetitive in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There are no significant patterns of duplicated or repeated logic. Most methods contain unique test logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods frequently interact with JUnit framework classes, but this is typical for a JUnit test file and does not necessarily suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- While several methods interact with test execution logic, changing a business rule or method signature would not require updating many methods in this file. Each method usually encapsulates a specific test scenario.

5. Summary Judgment:
- This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as each method is focused on a specific test case and interaction with the JUnit framework."
NumberTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains many test methods that individually test different variations of similar operations (e.g., `randomDigit`, `randomDigitNotZero`, `randomNumber`, `randomDouble`, `numberBetween`), but these methods are not repetitive or similar in the way that indicates Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repeated logic across methods, especially in the way tests are structured (e.g., checking the range of returned values, calculating uniqueness percentages), but this is typical for test cases to ensure correctness.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods mostly interact with the `faker` object to generate numbers, which indicates test isolation rather than widespread interactions.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to a business rule or method signature used in this file might require updates in multiple methods, but this is more due to the nature of testing different functionalities rather than Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file is a test suite for different number generation functionalities. While there are multiple methods, they are isolated tests for specific functionalities rather than signs of Shotgun Surgery."
TextEditorUtils.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file does not contain many methods that perform similar small tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no obvious duplication of logic in the methods provided.

3. Widespread External Interactions:

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to, for example, `enableHostEditorKeyBindings`, might require updates to methods like `enableHostEditorKeyBindingsSupport`, but these are specific to the scope and functionality they serve.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the given methods and interactions, changes in requirements would not likely necessitate many small edits across these methods to implement those changes."
PageResult.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the file contains standard getter and setter methods for the fields, but no repetitive or similar methods that perform small, similar, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no duplicated or repeated logic in the methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in the file primarily interact with the `PageUtil` class, but not in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods. For example, changing the default page size or updating the logic for calculating total pages would affect a couple of spots in the file, but not many.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The file is relatively straightforward with specific responsibilities and interactions."
HikariPool.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - While there are similar methods like `createPoolEntry` and `fillPool`, they are not small and repetitive but are different in their responsibilities.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no significant pattern of repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods often interact with many different classes (`MetricsTrackerFactory`, `ConcurrentBag`, `ScheduledExecutorService`, etc.), but these interactions are not in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely impact multiple methods, but the impact is not scattered across many similar changes but more focused on relevant methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not exhibit a pattern where a small change in requirements would necessitate numerous small edits in multiple places, so it does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The structure and methods are more modular and focused than repetitive and scattered."
SMSParsedResult.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains constructor overloading, which is not repetitive but rather provides flexibility in object creation.
   - Getter methods for `numbers`, `vias`, `subject`, and `body` are straightforward and there is no repetition among them.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - The methods `getSMSURI` and `getDisplayResult` have similar logic in appending different components to a `StringBuilder`, but the specifics and context of the data being appended are different enough to not be considered duplicated logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods primarily interact with the fields of the class and use `StringBuilder` to construct strings, which is common and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changing the way `numbers`, `vias`, `subject`, or `body` are handled would affect multiple methods, but the changes would be isolated to specific methods rather than requiring many small edits across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are multiple methods, they are not repetitive or similar in nature, and changes to one part of the file would not necessitate many small changes in other parts."
AnnotationScanner.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The interface defines only three distinct methods (`getScanAnnotation`, `addListener`, `validate`). There are no methods that perform similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: As this is an interface, it does not contain any logic duplication. It only specifies method signatures.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods do interact with different classes such as `Namespace`, `Object`, `Method`, `Annotation`, and `Class`, but it doesn't suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures used within this file would affect implementations of this interface, but not the interface itself.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, there are no signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
easyexcel-2.2.11_ExcelDataConvertException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file primarily contains getter and setter methods for the class fields, which is standard practice and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic in this file. Each method performs a distinct operation.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file do not show extensive interaction with other classes that would suggest widespread interdependencies.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to fields, like adding a new field, would require adding additional getter and setter methods, but this is not indicative of Shotgun Surgery on its own.
5. Summary Judgment: There are no signs in this file that suggest a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The file is a straightforward exception class with methods that handle fields specific to that class."
Connection.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are several methods that perform similar tasks (like different variations of `get*Reply` and `sendCommand`), these are not repetitive in a way that suggest Shotgun Surgery without context of other files.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There are patterns where similar logic is repeated, such as the try-catch blocks for handling socket exceptions in multiple methods (`setSoTimeout`, `setTimeoutInfinite`, `connect`, etc.). However, this is common error handling practice.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods frequently interact with external resources like `Socket` and `RedisOutputStream`, but not in a way that suggests many similar changes would be required in other files.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While some changes could affect multiple methods (e.g., a change in how `socket` is managed), this is not as extensive as what would typically indicate Shotgun Surgery. Each method has a specific responsibility.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places within this file or elsewhere. The file is well-structured with methods having clear responsibilities, and while there is some duplication (such as error handling), it is common and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
CameraInputController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are multiple small methods related to handling different input types (e.g., keyDown, keyUp, touchDown, touchUp, process, zoom), they are not performing the same tasks but rather handling different aspects of user input and camera control.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplication of logic. Each method has its specific purpose and does not contain repeated code blocks.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file frequently interact with the Camera and Vector3 classes, but these interactions are specific to camera control operations and not so extensive as to suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule or data structure changed, it would likely affect only relevant methods. For example, changing how the camera rotates or translates would impact specific methods like `rotate`, `translate`, or `process`, but not indiscriminately across many methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are focused and changes to one part of the functionality would affect only specific methods related to that functionality."
WebLogAspect.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - There are no methods that perform similar small tasks or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with several external classes and libraries (e.g., `ServletRequestAttributes`, `HttpServletRequest`, `URLUtil`), but not in a way that suggests similar changes would be required across methods if one were to change.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in business rules, data structures, or method signatures used in this file would likely require updates only in the affected areas. For example, changes to how the `WebLog` object is populated or the logging mechanism used would be localized to specific methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are structured in a way that isolates changes and does not suggest a Shotgun Surgery code smell."
ComparisonCriteria.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, there are no many methods that perform similar tasks in this file.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no repeated logic across methods within this file.
3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods interact primarily with arrays and objects within the method scope, not with many different classes.
4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in the business rule for asserting array equality would likely require updates in only a few methods (mainly `arrayEquals` and `assertElementsEqual`).
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are focused and do not show widespread dependencies that suggest Shotgun Surgery."
CodeCacheEventWalker.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains a limited set of methods. No obvious repetitive methods performing similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is a try-catch block handling address decoding that could potentially be extracted into a helper method if used elsewhere, but it's only present once here.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The methods interact with classes like `CodeCacheEvent`, `Compilation`, `IMetaMember`, and `CodeCacheWalkerResult`, but these interactions are focused and specific to the task of processing compilation events and results.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in how `CodeCacheEvent` or `Compilation` objects are used, or a change in how addresses are parsed, would directly impact this file. However, it would affect only specific parts of the file rather than many method implementations.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Most functionality is encapsulated within a single method that processes compilation events."
Dictionary.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   - There are similarities in methods like `getExtDictionarys`, `getRemoteExtDictionarys`, `getExtStopWordDictionarys`, and `getRemoteExtStopWordDictionarys`, where they all retrieve lists of file paths based on configuration properties and perform similar checks and trimming operations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - Similar logic for loading different dictionaries (e.g., `loadMainDict`, `loadSurnameDict`, `loadSuffixDict`, `loadPrepDict`, and `loadStopWordDict`). Each method initializes a `DictSegment`, retrieves and loads files, and handles exceptions similarly.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with file systems (`PathUtils`, `Files`), streams (`FileInputStream`, `BufferedReader`), HTTP clients (`CloseableHttpClient`), and logging (`Logger`).

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes affecting dictionary loading or file handling (e.g., modification of how files are read or properties are extracted) would require updating multiple similar methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are repetitive patterns and similar logic across methods, the context suggests these are variations of a central theme (loading dictionaries), which are handled through a consistent pattern. This does not strongly indicate Shotgun Surgery but rather a structured approach to handling multiple similar tasks."
SmartContentSelector.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains only two methods, with one of them (`selectList`) being a throwaway for unsupported functionality. There is no repetition or similarity in these methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic across the methods. The `select` method has its own distinct processing logic without repetition.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact primarily with string manipulations and basic data structures like `ArrayList` and `StringBuilder`. There are no widespread interactions with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the business rules or structures used here (such as the regex patterns or the logic for extracting content) would likely only impact the `select` method. There is no evidence that multiple methods would need similar changes.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many edits in multiple places. The file is concise and focused on a single operation."
Faker.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file primarily consists of getter methods for each field representing different data categories. These methods are not repetitive in terms of logic but are repetitive in structure.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic within the file. Each method is specific to returning an instance of a particular class.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Each method interacts with different classes (each returning an instance of a different category like `Ancient`, `App`, `Artist`, etc.), but this is expected behavior for a utility class and does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule or data structure changes, it would not require updating many methods in this file directly. The changes would more likely be in the respective classes being instantiated (e.g., `Ancient`, `App`, etc.).

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The file is structured as a facade pattern providing access to various data generation categories, and changes to its functionality are unlikely to require simultaneous edits across many methods."
ConstructorConstructor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains several methods (`newDefaultConstructor`, `newDefaultImplementationConstructor`, `newUnsafeAllocator`) that perform similar tasks by creating instances of different types. However, each method is tailored to handle a specific type of object construction and is not trivially repetitive.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repetition in the logic that checks for and creates instances of different types (e.g., `TreeSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `ArrayList`), but the repeated logic is encapsulated within distinct branches of a conditional statement.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The file interacts with various Java collection classes and types, but these interactions seem necessary for the specific functionality of providing instance creators rather than indicating Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the way instance creation is handled (e.g., altering how constructors are invoked or adding new types) would affect multiple methods, but these changes are expected due to the nature of the task this class performs.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are multiple methods that perform related tasks, the patterns are not indicative of Shotgun Surgery. Each method is designed to handle a specific case, and changes to this logic would not require a large number of small, similar edits elsewhere in this file."
StatisticSlot.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The methods `entry` and `exit` both handle similar logic for different states (entry, blocked, error in `entry`; success in `exit`), including interaction with `node`, `originNode`, and `Constants.ENTRY_NODE`.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- The logic for updating counts in `node`, `originNode`, and `Constants.ENTRY_NODE` is repeated in different branches of the try-catch block in the `entry` method and in the `exit` method.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods frequently interact with `Node`, `DefaultNode`, `Context`, `ResourceWrapper`, and `Constants`, suggesting that a change in these entities would require changes in multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- A change in how statistics are counted or logged would require updates in multiple places within the `entry` and `exit` methods, as well as potentially in `recordCompleteFor`.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The repetitive structure and repeated logic in the `entry` and `exit` methods, as well as the frequent interaction with multiple classes, strongly suggest that a small change in requirements could lead to many edits."
HttpConnection.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are several methods for setting different properties (like `cookie`, `data`, `header`), they are not repetitive in terms of logic but rather serve distinct functionalities.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The logic is well-organized and not duplicated. For example, encoding logic is contained in `encodeUrl` and `encodeMimeName`, and stream handling is centralized in methods like `writePost` and `serialiseRequestUrl`.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods do interact with various classes (e.g., `URL`, `HttpURLConnection`, `InputStream`), but these are standard Java IO and networking classes, not indicating Shotgun Surgery. Additionally, all interactions are relatively contained within their respective methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to a business rule or method signature in this file would generally impact only the methods directly related to that rule or signature. For example, changing the URL encoding logic would only affect `encodeUrl` and `punyUrl`.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The functionality is modular, and changes are likely to be localized."
FireBirdMetaModel.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file does not contain many methods that perform very similar tasks. The methods are generally focused on different aspects of handling database metadata for Firebird.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no obvious pattern of duplicated logic within the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods do not interact with an exceptionally broad range of external classes in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery. They mostly interact with database-related classes and utilities.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in a business rule (e.g., structural change in database metadata) or data structure would likely require changes in specific targeted methods rather than many small edits.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating no Shotgun Surgery."
PendingEntry.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No methods in this file appear to be repetitive or similar in function. Each getter method corresponds to a different field in the class.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods only interact with internal fields, not many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the business rule or data structure would minimally impact this file. For instance, adding a new field would require adding a new getter and potentially updating the constructor, but this is not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery as there are no repetitive methods, duplicated logic, or widespread external interactions that would necessitate many small edits in response to a single change in requirements."
Location.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No obvious repetitive or similar methods are present, though there are some methods performing similar tasks like `getLocationType()` which is overridden in multiple subclasses.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repeated logic, for example, in the `getStackSaver()` methods across `SyncEnterLocation`, `SyncExitLocation`, `ThrowLocation`, `ExitLocation`, `ExceptionExitLocation`, and `InvokeExceptionExitLocation` classes.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods primarily interact with internal classes like `InsnList`, `BindingContext`, `MethodProcessor`, etc., but there is no indication of frequent interactions with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to method signatures, data structures (like `AbstractInsnNode` or `LocationType`), or adding new types of locations could affect many places since there are many subclasses and methods perform different operations based on the type.

5. Summary Judgment: While there are some signs of duplicated logic and the change impact could be wide, the file does not clearly exhibit Shotgun Surgery based on the provided code. The repeated logic is mostly local to the subclasses and could be refactored, but it doesn't indicate that a small change would require many small edits throughout the code in unknown ways."
Evaluator.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as checking attributes, tags, and text content. However, these methods are logically grouped under different evaluators and serve distinct purposes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: While there are some repeated patterns, such as converting strings to lowercase or checking if an element has a specific attribute, these are encapsulated within methods and do not suggest widespread duplication.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods primarily interact with elements and their attributes within the Jsoup API, but do not suggest a wide interaction with many different classes that would imply Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While changing a method signature or a commonly used logic, such as attribute checking, would require updates across multiple methods, this is due to the nature of the functionality being implemented rather than a code smell.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, the file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are well-defined and logically grouped."
JsonAdapterAnnotationTypeAdapterFactory.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the file contains methods that have distinct responsibilities. `create` and `getTypeAdapter` methods perform different tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no duplicated logic across methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: While the methods interact with several classes (`Gson`, `JsonDeserializer`, `JsonSerializer`, `TypeAdapter`, `TypeAdapterFactory`), these interactions do not suggest that changes would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: A change in the business rule or data structure used (e.g., adding a new type to be handled) would impact this file but would not necessarily require many edits. The logic for handling new types is encapsulated in the `getTypeAdapter` method.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, there are no signs indicating that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
DriverDataSource.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are multiple methods, they are not performing similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method serves a different purpose, such as getting or setting specific properties, managing the database driver, or handling connections.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplication or repeated logic within the file. Each method has its own implementation, and even similar logic, like exception handling, is context-specific.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with external classes (like `Connection`, `Driver`, `DriverManager`), but these interactions are necessary for functioning as a data source and are not suggestive of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely affect only specific methods. For instance, changes related to driver handling would impact the constructor and methods that use `driver`. However, these changes would not necessitate similar changes across many methods.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method has a distinct responsibility, and changes would be localized."
AbstractMetaMember.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods in this file do not seem to perform repetitive or similar tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose, such as retrieving or setting specific attributes, checking conditions, or performing transformations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplicated logic across the methods. The methods that do share some similarities, such as those returning lists of attributes, use helper methods like `getLastCompilation()` to retrieve data from the `compilations` list.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with other classes like `Compilation`, `MemberBytecode`, `AssemblyMethod`, and `BytecodeInstruction` but each method is generally focused on a specific task that involves a limited subset of these interactions.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely affect specific methods rather than requiring updates in many methods. For example, a change in the `Compilation` class would primarily impact methods that directly use `Compilation`.

5. Summary Judgment: There are no strong indicators within this file that suggest a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits in multiple places. Each method is focused on a specific task, and there is no evidence of widespread, repetitive changes required by similar modifications."
ParentRunner.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - While there are some methods that perform similar tasks, such as `withBeforeClasses` and `withAfterClasses`, they are not numerous and seem to have distinct roles.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repeated logic, primarily around validation and rule handling, but it is encapsulated in methods like `validatePublicVoidNoArgMethods` and `classRules`.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods do interact with many different classes (e.g., `TestClass`, `Description`, `RunNotifier`), but these interactions are structured and necessary for the functionality of the Runner.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes, such as modifying how `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` methods are handled or how `ClassRule` interactions occur, would likely require changes in multiple methods, but these methods are interconnected and part of the core functionality.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are several places where similar logic exists, they are well-abstracted into methods, and the structure of the class does not suggest that a change in requirement would necessitate a plethora of small edits across many places."
OmsPortalOrderServiceImpl.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery"
JUnitCommandLineParseResult.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods in this file perform different tasks related to parsing command line arguments and creating test requests. There are no repetitive or similar methods that perform small, similar, or repetitive tasks.
   
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no明显的 repeated logic across methods. The logic for parsing options and parameters is distinct and serves different purposes.
   
3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with other classes such as `Classes` and `FilterFactories`, but these interactions are localized to specific tasks and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.
   
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in business rules or data structures would likely impact specific methods rather than many methods. For example, changing how classes are parsed would only affect `parseParameters`.
   
5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method has a distinct responsibility, and changes are localized."
ClassReader.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. However, there are loops and blocks of similar logic, such as the parsing of fields and methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repeated logic in loops that perform similar operations, such as reading attributes and handling UTF8 strings.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with the `TypeCollector` interface and internal data structures, but there is not a widespread interaction with many different classes that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the structure of the data being read or the logic of parsing these structures would likely require updates in multiple places, such as changes in the case statements for parsing different types in the constructor or adjustments in the `accept` method where the class header is visited.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - While there are some repeated patterns in the logic, there are not enough repetitive methods or widespread external interactions to conclusively indicate Shotgun Surgery in this file alone. Changes to the underlying data handling logic would likely require multiple updates, but this could be due to the complex nature of the parsing task rather than a design flaw indicating Shotgun Surgery."
XxlJobExecutor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods in the file are each performing distinct tasks related to initialization, destruction, and management of job-related components (like logging, admin-client connections, job handling, and thread management). There are no methods that seem to be shadows of each other.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic evident. Each method implements its functionality independently without sharing repeated logical constructs.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with other classes, but not in a way that suggests shotgun surgery. The interactions appear to be necessary for the functionality of the executor.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While changes in the job handling or logging mechanisms could require updates to multiple methods, this seems more specific to the roles of those methods rather than indicating a shotgun surgery scenario. The changes would likely be targeted to those relevant areas.

5. Summary Judgment: There are no signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places across this file. The file's methods and structures appear to be well-organized and independent of each other in a way that minimizes the need for widespread changes."
InPacketHandler.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are no repetitive or similar methods found in this file.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: The logic in the methods does not appear to be duplicated.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with several different classes (e.g., `PacketDecoder`, `NamespacesHub`, `NamespaceClient`), but it does not suggest Shotgun Surgery without broader context.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in business rules or method signatures would likely not require many updates in this file, as it handles a specific task.
5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
ConstrainableInputStream.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct responsibility, such as reading from an input stream, setting timeouts, or checking if the stream has expired.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no pattern of the same or very similar logic being repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file primarily interact with input streams and other classes related to input/output operations, consistently focusing on their specific functionality rather than interacting with a wide range of different classes in a way that suggests a shotgun surgery scenario.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file. Most methods are self-contained, and changes would typically affect only one or a few related methods.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, thus does not indicate Shotgun Surgery."
AndroidGL20.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains numerous methods that are simple wrappers around GLES20 methods, but they are not performing repetitive tasks in the sense of forwarding calls, updating similar fields, or making similar changes with variance.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is a pattern of repeated method signatures that forward calls with only slight variations, such as `glGenBuffer()`, `glGenFramebuffer()`, etc., which internally call their counterparts with additional parameters.
   - Similarly, `glUniform1fv(int location, int count, FloatBuffer v)`, `glUniform1fv(int location, int count, float[] v, int offset)`, and other similar overloaded methods exist, but these are standard overloading practices.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with GLES20 but are all related to OpenGL ES 2.0 operations and do not suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in the internal workings of GLES20 interactions would impact all methods, but changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures specific to this OpenGL wrapper would not significantly trigger widespread changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file primarily consists of method wrappers around GLES20 methods. While there is some repetition due to overloading and wrapper methods, it does not exhibit a pattern of Shotgun Surgery where small changes in requirements would necessitate numerous small edits in multiple places."
SaJwtUtil.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - `createToken(Object loginId, String keyt)` and `createToken(String loginType, Object loginId, String device, long timeout, String keyt)` both involve the creation of JWT tokens but differ in parameters and functionality.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - Both `createToken` methods involve checking if the `keyt` (secret key) is null and throwing an exception if it is.
   - Both `getTimeout` and `parseToken` methods involve parsing the token and handling exceptions similarly.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods frequently interact with `JWT`, `JSONObject`, and `SaTokenDao`, indicating they might need changes if these classes change.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changing how the JWT is created, validated, or the structure of the payloads would likely require changes in multiple methods (`createToken`, `parseToken`, `getTimeout`).

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file shows signs that a small change in requirements could require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the presence of Shotgun Surgery. Methods like `createToken`, `parseToken`, and `getTimeout` share duplicated logic and structure, suggesting changes in one might cascade to others."
Code.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   There are methods like `isbn10` and `isbn13` that have similar structures and logic for generating ISBN numbers with and without separators. However, these are not too repetitive given their distinct purposes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   There is some repeated logic in the check digit calculations and separator stripping, but it is encapsulated within specific private methods (`isbn10CheckDigit`, `isbn13CheckDigit`, `stripIsbnSeparator`) rather than being duplicated across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   The methods interact with the `Faker` class to generate values, but the interactions do not appear widespread or indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   A change in the `Faker` class or the logic for generating random numbers could impact multiple methods, but the impact seems manageable and not indicative of widespread changes required.

5. Summary Judgment:
   While there are some patterns of similar logic, they are localized and encapsulated in such a way that a single change in requirements would not necessitate extensive changes across the file."
HomeController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The methods `rest()` and `feign()` are both annotated with `@GlobalTransactional` and return a `String`. They both interact with the `OrderService` and `StorageService` to perform similar operations but use different interaction patterns (HTTP REST calls vs. direct method calls).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is some repeated logic such as checking the result for ""SUCCESS"" and throwing a `RuntimeException` if it doesn't match, but this is minimal and localized.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- The methods interact with external services (`StorageService`, `OrderService`) and make HTTP REST calls, but these interactions are clearly defined within each function and do not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- If the business rules for calling `storageService.storage()` or `orderService.order()`, or the REST calls change, only the specific methods (`feign()` or `rest()`) would need adjustments, not multiple similar changes across the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show patterns that indicate a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The logic is well-contained within each method, and changes would likely be isolated."
NacosWatch.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The file does not contain many methods that perform similar tasks. Each method serves a specific purpose, such as starting/stopping the service, handling service events, and selecting an instance.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is some repeated logic in the `start` and `stop` methods, particularly around using `nacosServiceManager.getNamingService` and handling exceptions. However, this repetition is minimal and focused on lifecycle management.

Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods in this file interact with external services primarily through `NamingService`. However, these interactions are encapsulated within methods like `start` and `stop`, and there isn't widespread interaction suggesting Shotgun Surgery.

Change Impact Within the File:
- A change in the business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file would not likely require updating many methods. The logic is well-encapsulated and modular.

Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are focused and do not exhibit the hallmark characteristics of Shotgun Surgery."
DictSegment.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `match` and `fillSegment` have multiple overloaded versions, but they are not just forwarding calls or updating similar fields; they have different parameters and logic.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are no significant patterns of duplicated logic across methods. The logic is consistent with the functionality of the trie structure.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact primarily with local data structures (`childrenArray`, `childrenMap`) and do not suggest frequent interaction with many external classes that would require coordinated changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to the structure (e.g., storage from array to map) or the matching algorithm would impact multiple methods, but these are logical changes rather than repetitive edits.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The design is modular and each method has a specific responsibility."
RocketMQMessageHandler.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are no many methods that perform similar or repetitive tasks. The methods handle different aspects of message processing and error handling.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no repeated logic across the methods. Each method handles its specific functionality, and the only slight repetition is in setting and checking the `sync` flag for synchronous and asynchronous send operations.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods interact with several classes (e.g., `RocketMQTemplate`, `Message`, `SendResult`), but these interactions are central to the message handling and do not suggest widespread changes would be required.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If there were significant changes to the messaging process or error handling strategies, it would impact several methods. However, given the clearly defined roles of each method, changes are likely to be localized.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery. While changes to core message handling or error management could impact several methods, the structure is well-defined and modular, reducing the likelihood of widespread similar changes."
NacosDiscoveryProperties.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains mostly getter and setter methods for various properties. While there are many of these, they do not perform similar or repetitive tasks beyond basic property management.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some repetitive logic in `overrideFromEnv` method where it overrides properties from the environment if they are not already set. However, this is localized and common in such configuration properties classes.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The file interacts with other classes mainly for configuration and environment-related tasks, which is typical for property management. There are no interactions indicative of Shotgun Surgery.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to properties, their logic, or related interactions would affect many methods but mostly due to the nature of how property management classes are structured and not because of Shotgun Surgery patterns.
5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. It is a typical Spring Boot configuration properties class with standard behavior for managing properties, handling external interactions, and setting up service configurations."
HtmlTreeBuilderStateTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The file contains methods that perform different tasks. `findConstantArrays` and `ensureSorted` handle static array fields, while the test methods `ensureArraysAreSorted`, `nestedAnchorElements01`, and `nestedAnchorElements02` test different aspects of HTML parsing.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repeated HTML structure in the test methods, but the logic handling it is not duplicated; the HTML strings are different.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with external classes mainly through the use of `Jsoup` for parsing HTML and `Constants` for array retrieval, but not in a way that suggests widespread changes would be required.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the business rule regarding how HTML parsing should work would likely affect the test methods, but changes to the logic in `findConstantArrays` or `ensureSorted` are less likely to affect the entire file.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method has a distinct responsibility and the duplication of HTML structures in test methods does not imply Shotgun Surgery."
QuotedStringTokenizer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains multiple constructors for `QuotedStringTokenizer`, which are similar but differ in the parameters they take. However, these are standard constructor overloads and are not small changes leading to Shotgun Surgery. The other methods like `hasMoreTokens`, `nextToken`, and their overridden versions in `Enumeration` interface are not repetitive tasks but essential implementations of different interfaces.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic in the `quote` methods. Both `quote(String s, String delim)` and `quote(String s)` check for conditions to quote the string and proceed to quote it using `quote(StringBuffer, String)`. This is not Shotgun Surgery per se but indicates an area where a method could be consolidated to reduce redundancy, though it does not inherently suggest frequent changes across many parts of the codebase.

Widespread External Interactions:
The methods in this file mainly interact with `String`, `StringBuffer`, and `StringBuilder`, which are core Java classes. There is no wide interaction with many different classes that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

Change Impact Within the File:
A change in the tokenizing logic or handling of quotes would impact several methods in this file directly, such as `hasMoreTokens()`, `nextToken()`, `quote(String s, String delim)`, `quote(String s)`, and `quote(StringBuffer buf, String s)`. However, this does not automatically indicate Shotgun Surgery as these changes are local and necessary if the core functionality changes.

Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, the file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While there is some redundancy in the `quote` methods and changes to core functionality would affect multiple methods, these do not indicate Shotgun Surgery."
CodeCacheStage.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   - The methods in this file do not perform many small or repetitive tasks. Each method (`redraw`, `addToGraph`, `showLabel`) has distinct responsibilities and does not seem repetitive.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods. Each method contains unique logic relevant to its function.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with classes such as `CodeCacheEvent`, `Tag`, and `JITWatchUI`, but the interactions do not suggest a wide spread requiring similar changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to `CodeCacheEvent` or related business rules would impact multiple methods, but these are due to the nature of the file's purpose (handling code cache events).

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many edits spread across the file."
HTTPSession.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
There are methods that perform similar tasks, such as `decodeHeader` and `parseBody`, but they handle different aspects of parsing HTTP requests and are not repetitive in the sense of Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic, especially in exception handling, but it is not across multiple methods in a way that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The methods in this file interact with various other classes and interfaces (such as `BufferedReader`, `OutputStream`, `ITempFile`, `ITempFileManager`), but the interactions do not suggest a wide spread need for changes across methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Changes in how headers are parsed or how multipart form data is handled could impact `decodeHeader` and `decodeMultipartFormData`. However, these methods are well-contained and changes would likely be localized.

5. Summary Judgment:
This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are mostly isolated in terms of functionality and the repeated logic is not widespread enough to constitute Shotgun Surgery."
ParserConfig.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

While the `ParserConfig` class is quite large and contains many methods, the methods are generally not performing repetitive or similar tasks that would suggest Shotgun Surgery. The class handles deserialization configuration, which involves setting up various mappings and checks, and these tasks are not distributed in a way that indicates Shotgun Surgery. Changes to deserialization rules or internal hash code deny/accept lists would likely affect specific methods rather than mandating changes across the board. The methods also interact with different classes but not in a manner that suggests widespread dependent changes."
btActivatingCollisionAlgorithm.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The file contains repetitive calls to the native method `CollisionJNI`, but these are typical for binding code and do not indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no duplicated or repeated logic in the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods in the file interact primarily with `CollisionJNI` for native method calls and do not show evidence of widespread interaction with other classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- If a business rule or method signature related to `CollisionJNI` were to change, it would affect multiple method calls, but this is typical for similar wrapping code and does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery; its structure is typical for a wrapper class and does not indicate that a small change would require many small edits in multiple places."
RedissonTransactionalBucket.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file contains similar methods such as `touchAsync()`, `unlinkAsync()`, `deleteAsync()`, `compareAndSetAsync()`, `getAndSetAsync()`, `getAndDeleteAsync()`, `setAsync(V newValue)`, `setAsync(V newValue, TransactionalOperation operation)`, `trySetAsync(V newValue)`, and `trySet(V newValue, TransactionalOperation operation)`. However, the similarity is primarily in the pattern of interacting with the `state` variable and adding operations to the `operations` list rather than simple repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic in the pattern of checking if the `state` is not `null` and then performing operations like adding operations to the `operations` list, updating the `state`, and returning results. This pattern is consistent across multiple methods, but it is used to handle different operations rather than duplicating a single logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The methods interact with various types of `TransactionalOperation` classes and use methods like `executeLocked()`, `checkState()`, and `getLock()`. This interaction is necessary for the functionality of the transactional bucket and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a change were to occur in how `TransactionOperation` classes are added to the `operations` list or how the `state` is updated, it would require changes in multiple methods. However, the changes would be systematic and related to the nature of the transactional operations rather than similar changes unrelated to the operation's nature.

5. Summary Judgment:
While there is repetitive logic and patterns in the methods, these are specific to the nature of handling transactional operations and interactions with the `state`. The changes required due to a change in these patterns would be consistent across the methods and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
HttpClientRequestContext.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
No, the file contains getter and setter methods which are not repetitive or similar in nature beyond their typical pattern.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No duplicated or repeated logic is present in the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The file interacts with classes from the `org.apache.http.client.methods` and `org.apache.http.client.protocol` packages, but does not show widespread interaction that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
A change to the `HttpUriRequest` or `HttpClientContext` classes, or their methods, would only require changes to the corresponding getter and setter methods, not many methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, the file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
DefaultMQAdminExtImpl.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

While reviewing the provided Java file, the following observations were made:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: There are several methods that perform similar tasks, often involving interactions with the broker or cluster, such as `examineTopicConfig`, `examineSubscriptionGroupConfig`, and `deleteSubscriptionGroup`. These methods follow a similar pattern of forwarding calls to the underlying `MQClientAPIImpl`. However, the tasks performed are distinct enough to not indicate repetitive or small-scale task repetition across methods.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There are instances of minor repetition, such as the block of code fetching `brokerAddr` in methods like `examineConsumerConnectionInfo`, `examineProducerConnectionInfo`, and `resetOffsetByTimestamp`. This is not extensive and does not suggest a significant amount of duplicated logic.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: The methods frequently interact with multiple classes, such as `MQClientAPIImpl` for broker interactions and `MessageExt` for message processing. However, these interactions do not suggest that a change in one class would require a synchronized change in many methods spread across the file.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Changing a business rule, data structure, or method signature in this file, such as the timeout mechanism or error handling, would likely require changes across multiple methods for consistency. However, these changes would mostly be mechanical forwarders rather than code with complex interdependencies.

5. **Summary Judgment**: While there are minor signs of some repetition and interaction with multiple classes, these observations do not strongly indicate that a small change in requirements would necessitate a large number of small, similar edits across the file. The methods are well-encapsulated and distinct in their functionality, which helps mitigate Shotgun Surgery."
Settings.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file primarily contains getter methods and some initialization logic. The methods are not repetitive or similar in the sense of performing the same small tasks across multiple methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated or repeated logic within the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file do not interact with many different classes. They mostly deal with their properties and an external `Environment` class, but these interactions are not widespread.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to the data structure or method signature used in this file do not seem to require updating many methods within the same file.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are straightforward and there is little evidence of repeated logic or structure that would suggest Shotgun Surgery."
ConnectionPageShellCommands.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
The file does not contain a large number of methods performing similar tasks. Methods such as `selectEventType` and `updateEvent` have some repetitive logic but are not similar in structure to other methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
While there is some repeated logic, especially in enabling/disabling UI components based on command existence/enabled state, this is contained within a few methods and does not suggest Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in this file interact with several classes (e.g., `DBPConnectionEventType`, `DBRShellCommand`, SWT widgets), but these interactions do not suggest that a change in one would require similar changes in many other methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Changes to the business rules related to `DBRShellCommand` properties would require updates in `updateEvent`, `selectEventType`, and potentially `saveSettings`.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery. The repeated logic is mostly contained within a few methods, and changes impact a limited number of methods."
MailUtil.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

**Repetitive or Similar Methods:**
The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as sending emails with different parameters (e.g., `sendText`, `sendHtml`, `send`, and their overloaded variants).

**Duplicated or Repeated Logic:**
The logic to split addresses is reused multiple times across different methods (e.g., `sendHtml`, `send`, `sendCustomMailAccount`).

**Widespread External Interactions:**
Methods frequently interact with other classes and utilities (e.g., `MailAccount`, `CollUtil`, `StrUtil`, `IoUtil`, `MapUtil`) in a way that suggests a change in one area would require similar changes across multiple methods.

**Change Impact Within the File:**
A change in the way emails are composed or sent would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as adding a new parameter to all `send` methods.

**Summary Judgment:**
Based on the presence of numerous similar methods, repeated logic, and interactions with various utilities, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
HttpRequestMethodsMatcherTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the methods are testing different aspects (`testEqualsAndHashCode`, `testGetContent`, `testGetToStringInfix`) of the `HttpRequestMethodsMatcher` class.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, each method has unique assertions relevant to the aspect it is testing.
3. Widespread External Interactions: No, the methods interact with the `HttpRequestMethodsMatcher` class and `HttpMethod` enum consistently without suggesting wider impacts of changes.
4. Change Impact Within the File: No significant indication that a change would require many edits; each method is isolated in its test logic.
5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery. Each test method is focused on specific functionality without suggesting that changes would ripple through the file or across many similar methods."
SymbolInfo.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- There are no many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose, such as calculating dimensions, handling lookups, or providing getters for specific fields.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no明显的duplicated or repeated logic within the file. Methods like `getHorizontalDataRegions` and `getVerticalDataRegions` contain similar switch statements, but they are specific to their respective concerns and do not suggest broader duplication issues.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. They primarily deal with the internal state and calculations specific to the `SymbolInfo` class, with minimal external interaction.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- If a business rule, data structure, or method signature were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file. Most methods are self-contained and perform specific, distinct tasks.

5. Summary Judgment:
- Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Each method is focused and changes mostly affect one or a few related methods at most."
TextureAtlas.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:  
   - Similar method patterns are observed in `findRegion(String name, int index)`, `findRegions(String name)`, `createSprite(String name, int index)`, `createSprites(String name)`, and others. However, these methods are distinct in their functionality and are typically not indicative of Shotgun Surgery as they are differentiated by their signature and return types.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:  
   - There are loops and logic snippets that repeat similar patterns, such as iterating over `regions`. However, each method serves a unique purpose, and the repeated logic is necessary for its functionality, not due to a lack of refactoring.

3. Widespread External Interactions:  
   - Methods in this file do interact with several classes (`Texture`, `TextureRegion`, `Sprite`, `NinePatch`, etc.), but these interactions are specific and designed within the context of loading and managing texture atlases, indicating good cohesion rather than Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:  
   - If a change were to occur, such as modifying the way regions are parsed or how textures are disposed, the impact could be widespread within the file due to the nature of the properties and methods handling these objects. However, this is a natural consequence of the class's responsibility and does not indicate Shotgun Surgery without additional context.

5. Summary Judgment:  
   - While the file contains methods that deal with similar tasks and have repeated logic, these are not indicative of Shotgun Surgery. The repeated logic is necessary for the class's functionality and is organized within cohesive methods. No signs suggest that changes in requirements would require scattered edits across multiple places in this file specifically for Shotgun Surgery."
ImmutableEnumMap.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods in this file are specific to the operations required by the `ImmutableEnumMap` and do not show repetitive or similar tasks beyond their intended purposes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no duplicated or repeated logic within this file; each method implements its specific functionality with minimal overlap.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods in this file interact with `EnumMap` for its operations but do not suggest widespread interactions that would necessitate coordinated changes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in the business rules or data structures used by `ImmutableEnumMap` wouldn't necessarily lead to changes in many methods. Each method is fairly isolated in its functionality.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - Based on the localized nature of the methods and their interactions, this file does not exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery. Changes to this class would likely be focused and not require extensive modification across many methods."
CharacterReader.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - Methods like `consumeTo`, `consumeToAny`, `consumeData`, `consumeAttributeQuoted`, `consumeRawData`, `consumeTagName`, `consumeToEnd`, `consumeLetterSequence`, `consumeLetterThenDigitSequence`, `consumeHexSequence`, and `consumeDigitSequence` perform similar tasks of consuming characters under different conditions, but they are not repetitive in structure and have distinct purposes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is some repeated logic, such as calling `bufferUp()` at the beginning of many methods, but this is for managing the buffer and is necessary for the functionality of these methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with `charBuf` and `reader`, but these interactions are specific to the functionality of each method and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to underlying structures or methods such as `bufferUp` or `cacheString` would affect many methods, but these changes would be due to the core functionality relying on these methods, not because of a shotgun surgery code smell.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits in multiple places. The repetition in method structure is related to their specific parsing and consuming tasks, which are inherently different tasks despite some overlap in buffer management and character consumption."
ArgumentTokenizer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks are found. There are two overloaded `tokenize` methods, but they have meaningful differences (one with an additional `stringify` parameter).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No patterns of repeated logic are observed across methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file interact primarily with core Java classes like `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `LinkedList`. There are no indications that they interact with many different classes in a way that suggests widespread changes due to a small change in requirements.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While the state machine logic might require updates if the rules for tokenization change, changes in other areas (like external interactions or unrelated code) don't seem to cascade into many modifications across this file.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The utility class has a focused responsibility for tokenizing command-line style strings and handling quotes and escape characters, which is encapsulated fairly well."
JobLogController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - No clear patterns of repetitive or similar methods performing small or repetitive tasks are present.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are no obvious cases of repeated logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with several external classes and methods, such as DAOs and `XxlJobScheduler`. However, these interactions do not suggest that changes in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely affect multiple methods. For example, changes to how job logs are stored or retrieved could impact most methods. However, these are changes at a broader level rather than small, scattered changes.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While there are several methods that could be affected by broader changes in the application's behavior, this is typical for controllers managing multiple aspects of job logs and does not indicate the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
Monitor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: There are no many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks in this file.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file primarily interact with the HTTP client and logging utilities. There is no indication of interactions with many different classes that would suggest shotgun surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: While there are a few hardcoded values and specific HTTP header names, changes to these would not likely require updating many methods. The main business logic is encapsulated within one method, `runUnprivileged`.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is relatively isolated, and changes to the monitored URL, HTTP headers, or logging would not necessitate numerous changes across the file or other files."
HistoryPageFilter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- No obvious signs of repetitive methods. Methods like `addQueueItem` and `addRun` handle separate types but do similar tasks internally.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- The `fitsSearchParams` method is duplicated for different parameter types (`Queue.Item` and `Run`), which can be refactored but doesn't necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods interact with various Jenkins classes (e.g., `Run`, `Queue.Item`, `Job`), but these interactions are scoped to the type of items being handled.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- Changes in business rules around filtering or entry ID management might impact multiple methods, but the design seems to encapsulate related tasks together.

5. Summary Judgment:
- While there are opportunities for refactoring (like combining similar search parameter logic), the file does not exhibit widespread patterns that would require many changes for a small adjustment in requirements."
HandshakeData.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: This file contains standard getter methods for different fields, which is typical for data classes. There is no indication of repetitive methods performing similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no visible duplicate or repeated logic within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods in this file primarily deal with getting fields and extracting a single URL parameter; there is no frequent interaction with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to data structures or method signatures here would likely affect only a few related methods, not many across the file.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the provided code, there are no signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places within this file."
Vault.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The methods `lockedProperty()`, `processingProperty()`, `unlockedProperty()`, `missingProperty()`, `needsMigrationProperty()`, `unknownErrorProperty()`, and corresponding getter methods (`isLocked()`, `isProcessing()`, etc.) are similar, but they are all related to the state of the vault and initializing bindings. They are not repetitive tasks but necessary to expose the underlying state properties.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No significant pattern of duplicated or repeated logic across methods is observed. Each method performs its specific task related to the vault's state management or behavior.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
While there are interactions with multiple classes (`CryptoFileSystem`, `Volume`, `VaultSettings`, etc.), these interactions are necessary for the vault's functionality rather than suggest a shotgun surgery smell. Each method interacts externally as needed without implying a widespread need for change.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
While some changes to `VaultSettings`, `Volume`, or `CryptoFileSystem` might require changes in multiple places, these reflect functional dependencies rather than shotgun surgery. For example, adding another state to `VaultState` would require changes in how states are evaluated but does not imply a shotgun surgery scenario where a small requirement change would cascade to many unrelated methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not exhibit symptoms of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are well-organized around specific functionality related to vault operations and state management. Changes to the underlying logic or requirements would likely affect related methods but not in a scatter-shot, unrelated manner."
CommandDecoder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains multiple methods that deal with decoding different parts of the Redis protocol or handling different types of responses, but they are not identical or nearly identical. Each method has a specific purpose within the decoding process.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: While there are some repeated logic patterns, such as error handling and reading data from the `ByteBuf` (e.g., reading strings, longs), these patterns are necessary for a protocol decoder and are not repeated in an excessive manner within this single file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: This class interacts with several other classes and types (`QueueCommand`, `CommandData`, `Channel`, `ByteBuf`, etc.), but these interactions are specific to the protocol decoding task and do not suggest a Shotgun Surgery scenario within a single file.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If there were a change in the Redis protocol or in how data is read from the `ByteBuf`, it would likely affect multiple methods, but this impact is localized to the decoding tasks and error handling to ensure robustness.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is structured around specific tasks related to protocol decoding and error handling without excessive repetition that would indicate Shotgun Surgery."
FxApplication.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   - The methods within the class are not performing repetitive or very similar small tasks. Each method seems to have distinct functionalities related to the UI components and vault operations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There are no apparent patterns of duplicated or very similar logic repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - While the methods interact with various classes (like `Vault`, `UnlockComponent.Builder`, `LockComponent.Builder`, etc.), these interactions appear specific to the functionality of each method and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - A change in business rules, such as adding a new UI theme, could require additions in theme-related methods like `loadSelectedStyleSheet`, `systemInterfaceThemeChanged`, `applyLightTheme`, and `applyDarkTheme`. However, this is limited to theme-related functionalities and does not appear contagious across many methods.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - This file does not show strong evidence of Shotgun Surgery as the methods have distinct focuses and the impact of a change is typically localized."
HttpHeadRequestTest.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

### Analysis:
1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Multiple test methods (`testDecodingFieldWithEmptyValueAndFieldWithMissingValueGiveDifferentResults`, `testDecodingMixtureOfParameters`, `testDecodingParametersWithSingleValue`, `testDecodingParametersWithSingleValueAndMissingValue`, `testDecodingSingleFieldRepeated`, `testMultipleGetParameters`, `testMultipleGetParametersWithMissingValue`, `testMultipleGetParametersWithMissingValueAndRequestHeaders`, `testSingleGetParameter`, `testMultipleValueGetParameter`, `testSingleGetParameterWithNoValue`) perform similar actions by invoking the server with different request strings and checking the response contents.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There is repeated logic for invoking the server with specific request strings and verifying the contents of the response. This duplication could indicate that changes to the request format or response verification logic would require updates across multiple methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Methods interact with the `HttpServerTest` class and its fields (`testServer.decodedParamters`, `testServer.queryParameterString`, `testServer.parms`, `testServer.parameters`, `testServer.header`, `testServer.files`, `testServer.uri`, `testServer.method`). Changes to these fields or their interactions could necessitate changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Changes to how server requests are constructed, how responses are decoded, or how headers and parameters are verified could require modifications in numerous methods. For example, adding a new query parameter or modifying how headers are processed would likely involve changes across several test methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to multiple test methods performing similar tasks with slight variations. Changes that impact the server setup, request invocation, or response verification would likely require edits to many methods, exemplifying the Shotgun Surgery smell."
BatchExecutor.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:  
   - The methods `doQuery`, `doQueryCursor`, and `doFlushStatements` have some repeated setup logic, but they perform different operations and are not forwarding calls or similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:  
   - The repeated setup logic seen in `doQuery`, `doQueryCursor`, and `doFlushStatements` involves getting a connection, preparing a statement, and parameterizing it. This is necessary for different query operations and doesn't indicate Shotgun Surgery.

3. Widespread External Interactions:  
   - Methods frequently interact with `Configuration`, `MappedStatement`, `StatementHandler`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects, but these interactions are standard for an executor class and do not suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:  
   - A change in the way statements are prepared, connections are managed, or parameters are handled would impact multiple methods, but this is expected behavior for a class that handles different types of queries and updates.

5. Summary Judgment:  
   - This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods within this file are cohesive and handle their specific tasks without indicating Shotgun Surgery."
TokenQueue.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

### Summary Judgment:
This file does not show clear signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are multiple methods that handle similar tasks such as consuming or matching parts of a queue, these methods have distinct purposes and do not indicate that a small change would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are generally focused on specific parsing and consuming behaviors, and there is no evidence that a single change would necessitate widespread modifications across these methods."
DubboServiceMetadataRepository.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

   - `resolveExpression` has two overloaded versions, which is understandable for different parameters.
   - `letterify` has two overloaded versions to provide different functionality based on a boolean flag.
   - `bothify` has overloaded versions, which is a common pattern to provide similar functionality with different parameters.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There is no obvious repeated logic. Overloading methods is used to avoid duplication.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - The class interacts with other classes like `Locale`, `Logger`, `List`, and `Faker`, but these interactions do not suggest Shotgun Surgery.
   - The interactions are mostly with data structures and logging, which are common.

4. Change Impact Within the File:

   - Methods like `startUnlockAnimation()` and `stopUnlockAnimation()` manage similar UI elements and states, but they are specific to their function and do not appear repetitive or similar enough to suggest Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   - There does not seem to be repeated logic across methods. Each method performs its own specific task.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   - Methods interact with various UI elements and system components (e.g., `keychain`, `passwordEntryLock`). While there are multiple interactions, these seem necessary for the functionality and do not indicate Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   - Changes in business rules or data structures would likely affect specific methods rather than necessitating numerous small changes across them. For example, changes to cryptography might affect password handling methods but not the UI setup or animations.

5. Summary Judgment:
   - The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While there are multiple methods and interactions, they are purposefully designed to support the controller’s functionality and do not exhibit the hallmarks of Shotgun Surgery."
LexemePath.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While there are some methods that perform related tasks, such as `addCrossLexeme` and `addNotCrossLexeme`, they are not repetitive but rather handle different scenarios of adding lexemes to the path.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is some logic that is repeated, particularly around updating `pathEnd` and `payloadLength`, but this is not extensive enough to suggest Shotgun Surgery across the entire codebase.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with `Lexeme` instances and the `QuickSortSet` superclass, but these interactions do not appear to be widespread or indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to `Lexeme` or the structure of `LexemePath` would impact several methods, due to the shared logic for updating path attributes, but this does not necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery in the context of scattered changes across the codebase due to a single requirement change.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery, as changes would mostly affect a few related methods rather than necessitating similar changes across many unrelated parts of the codebase."

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are well-separated, and responsibilities are clearly defined."
ParamFlowChecker.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct responsibility, such as checking conditions for parameter flow control, handling cluster token requests, and passing checks based on different control behaviors.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. Different methods handle different aspects of the token retrieval and control logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions: While methods in this file interact with a variety of classes and utilities, these interactions are necessary for the functionality of the class and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

AbortedTransactionException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains three constructors that initialize the superclass `JedisDataException` in slightly different ways. These methods are not performing repetitive tasks but are necessary for proper constructor overloading.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic in the file. Each constructor is passing its parameters to the superclass constructor, and there is no additional logic that is repeated.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods in this file interact minimally with external classes. They only call the superclass constructor with the provided parameters.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If the signature of the `JedisDataException` constructor were to change, this would require changes in all three constructors in this file. However, this is a single point of impact due to inheritance and not indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: There are no symptoms in this file that suggest a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits in multiple places. The file is straightforward and focused on exception handling."
HttpRequest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places.

Lorem.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- Multiple `characters` methods with varying parameters.

Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- Similar methods like `words(int num)` and `words()` creating lists of words.
- Similar method calls and logic in `sentence(int wordCount, int randomWordsToAdd)` and related methods.

Widespread External Interactions:
- Frequent interactions with `Faker` and `fakeValuesService`, hinting at external dependencies that might lead to cascading changes.

Change Impact Within the File:
- A change in the logic for generating a single character (e.g., including/excluding digits) would require updating multiple `characters` methods.
- Changes to the word or sentence generation logic would cascade through `sentence`, `sentences`, `paragraph`, and `paragraphs`.

Summary Judgment:
The presence of numerous methods with similar functionalities and parameters, repeated logic patterns, and广泛的 external interactions suggest that changes to core functionalities would require modifications in multiple methods, indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
HostAndPort.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the methods perform distinct tasks specific to parsing, validating, and manipulating host and port information.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No significant duplicated logic is found. Each method handles different aspects of host and port parsing and construction.

Based on the analysis of the provided Java file, there are no evident signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods in the file seem to follow a single responsibility, with tests structured around specific functionalities rather than repetitive or similar tasks. There is no widespread external interaction that suggests changes in one place would necessitate changes in many methods. If business rules, data structures, or method signatures were to change, it is unlikely that it would require updating many methods in this file."
ServiceLoader.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
- The file contains two main methods, `load(Class<T> clazz, ClassLoader classLoader)` and `load(URL url, Set<String> set)`, which are quite distinct in their functionality and do not appear repetitive or similar.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
- There is no duplicated or repeated logic across methods within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
- Methods in this file do frequently interact with external classes such as `ClassLoader`, `URL`, `InputStream`, `BufferedReader`, and `IOException`, but these interactions are specific to service loading and do not suggest widespread similar changes across different places.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
- If a business rule or data structure were to change, it might affect the `load` methods, but this does not necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery as the file primarily focuses on service loading.

5. Summary Judgment:
- The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. It follows a clear and consistent pattern without repetitive or similar tasks that would be indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
JedisSentinelPool.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The file contains numerous constructors with repetitive parameters and similar initialization logic, which suggests a pattern that could be extended or modified extensively if requirements change, indicating shotgun surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Similar configuration and initialization logic are repeated across multiple constructors, focusing on setting up the Jedis connection with various parameters, hinting at duplicated logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Methods like `initSentinels` and the logic within `MasterListener` interact with external systems (Redis, Sentinel), and changing these interactions might necessitate changes in multiple constructors and methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changing any configuration parameters or initialization logic in the constructors would require updating many of them, as they share common initialization steps, leading to shotgun surgery.

5. Summary Judgment: The presence of many constructors with nearly identical logic and parameters indicates that a change affecting the initialization or configuration would need to be replicated across multiple constructors, suggesting Shotgun Surgery."
SimpleEchoSocket.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: The methods perform different tasks (handling connection close, establishment, and message reception) without noticeable repetition.
2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no duplicated logic across the methods.
3. Widespread External Interactions: The file interacts with a limited set of external classes (`Session`, `Future`) and seems cohesive for its function.
4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes to business rules (like message handling) or data structures would impact specific methods directly related to those changes but not many methods indiscriminately.
5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. Each method has a clear, distinct purpose, and changes to the logic in one method would not require changes in many others."
RestAdapter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: While the file has several methods (`invoke`, `logAndReplaceRequest`, `logAndReplaceResponse`, etc.), they serve distinct purposes in the request and response handling, serialization/deserialization, and logging processes. They are not repeating or forwarding similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: There is no significant duplication of logic across methods. Each method has its own responsibility, and while there are some repeated patterns like logging and error handling, these are necessary for the functionality provided by the class.

3. Widespread External Interactions: The methods interact with various classes (`Client`, `Converter`, `Request`, `Response`, etc.), but these interactions are part of the necessary operations for a REST client and do not suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Changes in business rules, data structures, or method signatures might impact several methods due to the intertwined nature of the request-process-response cycle, but this file is structured to modularize these changes and propagate them through well-defined interfaces and methods.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis of the file, there are no signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The class is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, which helps mitigate the Shotgun Surgery smell."
