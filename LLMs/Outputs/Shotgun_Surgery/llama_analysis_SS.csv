AccessControlLogEntry.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Yes**, the class contains many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, such as getter methods (`getCount()`, `getReason()`, etc.) that retrieve field values.

2. **Yes**, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as casting and retrieving values from the `map` parameter in the constructor and assigning them to corresponding fields.

3. **No**, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes, but the class itself interacts with a map of data from an external source (Redis server).

4. **Yes**, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (for example, if the Redis server starts returning data in a different format), it would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as the constructor and getter methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The presence of many getter methods with similar logic, the repetition of casting and retrieving values in the constructor, and the potential impact of changes in the Redis server's data format on multiple methods in the class suggest that this file shows signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
Preconditions.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No, the file does not contain many methods that perform similar tasks. Methods like checkArgument() and checkState() have various overloads, but they all serve a distinct purpose.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No, the logic is not duplicated across methods. The overloads for checkArgument and checkState have a clear purpose and don't duplicate logic from other methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
No, the class doesn't frequently interact with many different classes, suggesting a low risk of Shotgun Surgery due to this factor.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it's unlikely to require updating many methods in this file. The impact would be limited to specific areas of the class.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file doesn't show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is a key characteristic of Shotgun Surgery. Despite the large number of overloads, the methods are well-organized and focused on specific tasks, minimizing the risk of Shotgun Surgery."

3. Methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mostly with predefined Java security classes.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely not require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `DEFAULT_CIPHER_ALGORITHM` were to change, only the `aesEncrypt` and `aesDecrypt` methods would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are well-structured and distinct, with minimal repetitive or similar logic."
ClassLoaderCommand.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `processClassLoader`, `processResources`, `processLoadClass`, and `processAllClasses`, which all seem to be processing different aspects of classloaders.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the usage of `RowAffect` and `process.appendResult` in several methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `ClassLoader`, `Instrumentation`, `CommandProcess`, and others, which suggests that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `ClassLoader` class were to change, many methods in this file would need to be updated to reflect those changes. Other examples include changes to the `Instrumentation` interface or the `CommandProcess` class.

5. **Summary Judgment**: This file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places.

GeneralAppIdDecoder.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions:
1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
There are multiple methods that perform similar tasks, such as decodeNumeric, decodeIsoIec646, and decodeAlphanumeric, which all extract values from the information bit array. Additionally, the parseNumericBlock, parseIsoIec646Block, and parseAlphaBlock methods have similar structures, with the main difference being the type of data they are parsing.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There are repeated logic patterns across multiple methods, such as the use of extractNumericValueFromBitArray to extract values from the information bit array, and the use of switch statements to determine the decoded character.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes, as most of the interactions are with the information bit array and other internal methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the format of the information bit array were to change, the extractNumericValueFromBitArray method would need to be updated, which would likely require changes to the decodeNumeric, decodeIsoIec646, and decodeAlphanumeric methods. Similarly, if the decoding rules for a particular type of data were to change, the corresponding parsing method (e.g., parseNumericBlock) would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The repeated logic patterns and similar methods make it likely that changes to one part of the code would require changes to other parts as well. Additionally, the complexity of the decoding rules and the multiple places where they are implemented make it likely that changes to those rules would require widespread updates."

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. However, the class itself has many interactions with other classes, which could potentially lead to Shotgun Surgery if similar interactions exist in other classes.

4. Yes, if certain business rules, data structures, or method signatures used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating some methods in this file. For example, changes to the `Configuration` class or the `NamespacesHub` class could require updates to the `start` method and other methods that interact with these classes.

5. Summary Judgment: No, based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). However, the class's interactions with many other classes could potentially contribute to Shotgun Surgery if similar interactions exist in other classes."
JobGroupController.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, the `save` and `update` methods have very similar validation logic for `xxlJobGroup` fields.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, there is repeated validation logic for `xxlJobGroup` fields in the `save` and `update` methods. The same checks are performed for `appname` and `title`.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, multiple methods in this file interact with different DAO classes (`xxlJobInfoDao`, `xxlJobGroupDao`, `xxlJobRegistryDao`).

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, if the business rule or validation for `xxlJobGroup` fields changes, it would likely require updating both the `save` and `update` methods. For example, if the length of `appname` or `title` is changed, both methods would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: The presence of repetitive validation logic, duplicated code, and interactions with multiple DAO classes suggests that a small change in requirements could require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the Shotgun Surgery code smell. Specifically:
- Validation logic in `save` and `update` methods is similar and duplicated.
- Multiple methods interact with different DAO classes, indicating a potential for widespread changes if any of these interactions need to be updated.
- Changes to business rules or validation for `xxlJobGroup` fields would require updating multiple methods."

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: 
YES, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example:
   - A change to the VertexAttributes used in rendering would affect setVertexData(), allocRenderable(), fillVerticesGPU(), and other related methods.
   - Changing the data representation of particles (e.g., using different channels) would impact methods like fillVerticesGPU() and fillVerticesToScreenCPU().
   - Modifying the rendering modes or adding a new mode would require changes in methods like setAlignMode() and the rendering logic.

5. **Summary Judgment**: 
YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The evidence includes repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread interactions with other classes, and a high change impact within the file. Any changes to the rendering pipeline, data structures, or method signatures would likely require many small, similar edits across the class. This supports the conclusion that this file exhibits symptoms of Shotgun Surgery."
BrokerController.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, there are many methods that seem to perform similar tasks, such as the `headSlowTimeMills4SendThreadPoolQueue()`, `headSlowTimeMills4PullThreadPoolQueue()`, `headSlowTimeMills4QueryThreadPoolQueue()`, and `headSlowTimeMills4EndTransactionThreadPoolQueue()` methods, which all call the same `headSlowTimeMills()` method with a different queue.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file, such as the `registerProcessor()` method where multiple `registerProcessor()` calls are made with similar parameters.

Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. This is due to the presence of repetitive methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions, which all contribute to a high likelihood of needing to make many changes in response to a small change in requirements."
StringUtils.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: 
   There are many methods that perform string-related operations. Some of these methods have similar functionality but with different parameters. However, this seems to be more related to having a utility class for string operations rather than indicating the ""Shotgun Surgery"" smell.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**:
   There is no evident duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**:
   This class does not seem to frequently interact with many different classes. Most interactions are limited to string and character classes, which are fundamental and not specific to any particular external system or class.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**:
   If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it's possible that some methods might need updating, especially if they were dependent on the changed rule or structure. However, this doesn't seem to be widespread enough to indicate the Shotgun Surgery smell strongly.

5. **Summary Judgment**:
   Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs of the Shotgun Surgery smell. The methods are generally focused on string utility operations, and while there are many of them, they don't seem to be overly repetitive or interdependent in a way that would suggest a small change would require widespread edits."

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, the methods in this file primarily interact with `Packet`, `JsonSupport`, `Configuration`, and `ByteBufAllocator` classes, which are directly related to the purpose of this class. There doesn't seem to be an excessive number of external interactions that would suggest a need for widespread changes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating a few methods. For example, changes to the `Packet` class's structure or the `JsonSupport` interface could impact several methods within this file. However, this does not necessarily imply a Shotgun Surgery scenario as these changes would likely be contained within this class or closely related classes.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The class seems to encapsulate its logic and interactions in a way that limits the potential for widespread, simultaneous changes across the class."

The evidence includes the presence of many similar getter and setter methods, the repetition of logic across these methods, and the widespread interaction with multiple fields, which suggests that changes to one part of the class would require updates to many other parts."
MethodRoadie.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

To answer the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   No, the methods in this file do not perform overly similar tasks. They all have distinct purposes in the context of running a test method.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   No, there is no notable duplicated or repeated logic across methods within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   No, methods in this file primarily interact with the contained test instance and the notifier, without frequent interactions with many different external classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file. An example might include changing how failures are reported, which could affect only the `addFailure` method.

5. Summary Judgment:
   The file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits across multiple places within this file. The structure and method responsibilities are relatively contained and distinct. However, if similar patterns exist across other files, it could indicate a broader issue. But based on this file alone, such evidence is not compelling."
StubConnection.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as checking for `throwException` and throwing a `SQLException` if it's true. Many methods also return `null` or an empty value.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns of repeated logic, such as the checks for `throwException` in multiple methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with other classes, especially in the `SQL` package, suggesting that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the database connection logic were to change, many of the `prepareStatement` and `createStatement` methods would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the repetitive checks for `throwException`, the many methods that return `null` or empty values, and the frequent interactions with other classes, which together suggest a codebase that may be prone to Shotgun Surgery."
ExpandedProductParsedResult.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, there are many getter methods (e.g., `getProductID`, `getSscc`, `getLotNumber`, etc.) that perform similar tasks, which could indicate a potential for Shotgun Surgery if this pattern is repeated in other files.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, the `equals` and `hashCode` methods contain similar patterns of comparing and hashing the same fields, which could be duplicated logic if other classes have similar structures.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, the class interacts with its own fields extensively, but there aren't many interactions with different classes. However, the presence of many fields and getter methods could lead to widespread interactions if other classes depend on these.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., adding or removing a field), it would likely require updating many methods in this file (e.g., `equals`, `hashCode`, and all the getter methods).

5. Summary Judgment: 
The evidence suggesting Shotgun Surgery includes the repetition of similar getter methods, duplicated logic in `equals` and `hashCode`, and the potential for widespread changes if the class structure or any of its fields are modified.

SaFoxUtil.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are many methods that perform similar tasks, such as string manipulation (e.g., `getRandomString`, `isEmpty`, `isNotEmpty`, `convertStringToList`, `convertListToString`) and URL-related operations (e.g., `joinParam`, `joinSharpParam`, `encodeUrl`, `decoderUrl`).

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns of repeated logic, such as the use of `isEmpty` and `isNotEmpty` checks in multiple methods, and similar string concatenation logic in methods like `arrayJoin` and `convertListToString`.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `String`, `List`, `Random`, `Date`, and `URLDecoder`, which could lead to a situation where a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example:
   - If the `isEmpty` method were to change its implementation, all methods that use it would need to be updated.
   - If the `URL_REGEX` constant were to change, the `isUrl` method would need to be updated.
   - If the character encoding used in the `encodeUrl` and `decoderUrl` methods were to change, these methods would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery, as a small change in requirements would likely require many small edits in multiple places within this file and potentially in other files that use its methods."
Stage.java,"1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: 
   There are many methods in this class that perform similar tasks, such as `touchDown`, `touchDragged`, `touchUp`, `keyDown`, `keyUp`, `keyTyped`. They all create an `InputEvent` object, set various properties on it, and then fire the event. However, these methods are not necessarily repetitive or redundant, as they each handle different types of input events and have distinct logic for handling those events.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: 
   The logic for creating and firing an `InputEvent` is repeated in several methods, but it is not excessively duplicated. However, there is some similar logic for checking the focus actor and canceling touch focus in multiple methods. 

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: 
   The class interacts with many other classes, including `Viewport`, `Batch`, `Actor`, `InputEvent`, `EventListener`, and `FocusEvent`. However, most of these interactions are necessary for the class's functionality and are not excessive.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: 
   If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it could likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `InputEvent` class changed, many methods in this class would need to be updated to reflect those changes. Similarly, if the way touch focus is managed changed, several methods would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: 
   YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The class has a high potential for shotgun surgery due to its complex logic and interactions with many other classes. Changes to certain classes or methods could require updates to multiple methods in this class. For example, changes to the `InputEvent` or `Actor` classes could affect many methods in this class. The similar logic in multiple methods, such as event creation and firing, also increases the likelihood of shotgun surgery."

Here are the answers to the given questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No, this file does not contain an excessive number of methods that perform similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No, I did not find duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
No, the methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating some methods. For example, if the `CreditCardType` enum were to change, the `creditCard(CreditCardType creditCardType)` method would need to be updated. However, such changes would likely be limited to a specific area of the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The methods are generally well-defined and unique in their purpose, and changes to one method would not likely require widespread changes throughout the file."
AdminBrokerProcessor.java,"## 1. Repetitive or Similar Methods
The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `getMaxOffset`, `getMinOffset`, `getEarliestMsgStoretime`, and `searchOffsetByTimestamp`, which all retrieve various types of message offsets. Additionally, there are multiple methods for handling different types of requests, such as `updateAndCreateTopic`, `deleteTopic`, `updateAndCreateAccessConfig`, and `deleteAccessConfig`, which all follow similar patterns.

## 2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic
There is repeated logic across multiple methods, such as the decoding of request headers and the creation of response commands. For example, the `updateAndCreateTopic` and `deleteTopic` methods both decode a request header and create a response command in a similar way.

## 3. Widespread External Interactions
The methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `BrokerController`, `MessageStore`, `ConsumerManager`, and `TopicConfigManager`. This suggests that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.

## 4. Change Impact Within the File
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the structure of the `RemotingCommand` object were to change, it would likely require updates to all the methods that create and decode these objects. Similarly, if the `BrokerController` class were to change, it would likely require updates to all the methods that interact with it.

## 5. Summary Judgment
YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The evidence for this includes:
* Many methods performing similar tasks and interacting with multiple classes.
* Repeated logic across multiple methods for decoding request headers and creating response commands.
* Frequent interactions with many different classes, making it likely that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.
* The potential for a change in a business rule, data structure, or method signature to require updates to many methods in this file."

PrefixPluginLogger.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.
2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.
3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.
4. Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many parts of the class, such as the `PrefixPluginLogger` constructor, the `logMessage` method, and the `markers` map, especially if the marking mechanism changes.
5. Summary Judgment: The file shows potential signs that could contribute to the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The potential for change lies in the marking mechanism, which, if altered, could necessitate updates in multiple places within this class and possibly others that utilize similar logging mechanisms, indicating a localized risk that could amplify if this pattern is repeated across the codebase."
BitMatrix.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** The class contains several methods for setting, getting, flipping, and clearing bits (e.g., `set`, `get`, `flip`, `xor`, `clear`, `setRegion`), which perform similar tasks. This suggests that a small change in the requirements could necessitate multiple, similar changes across these methods.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** The `getTopLeftOnBit` and `getBottomRightOnBit` methods contain similar logic to find the first or last set bit in the matrix, which could be refactored or extracted into a separate method to reduce duplication.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** The `BitMatrix` class interacts closely with the `BitArray` class through several methods (e.g., `xor`, `getRow`, `setRow`). If the `BitArray` class changes, these interactions might require similar changes in multiple methods of the `BitMatrix` class.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** A change in the data structure used by the `BitMatrix` class (e.g., switching from an array of `int`s to a different representation) would likely require updates to many methods within this file, such as `get`, `set`, `flip`, `clear`, and others. Similarly, a change in the `BitArray` class used by the `BitMatrix` class could necessitate widespread changes.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The `BitMatrix` class exhibits several characteristics that suggest it might be vulnerable to the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The presence of multiple methods performing similar tasks, duplicated logic, interactions with other classes that could require synchronized changes, and the potential for widespread impact from changes to the data structure or related classes all contribute to this assessment. Refactoring or redesigning the class to reduce these aspects could help mitigate the risk of Shotgun Surgery."

2. There are no obvious patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file.

3. Methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes, suggesting that changes in one place would not require similar changes in many methods.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only a few specific methods in this file, such as the `addTrigger` method or the `start` and `stop` methods.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The file's structure and logic are relatively self-contained and focused on managing a job trigger pool, without evident duplication or widespread interactions that would amplify the impact of changes."

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `vault`, `keychain`, `executor`, and `scheduler`, which could indicate a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, such as the migration process itself or the vault's state transitions, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, changes to the `migrate()` method's exception handling could impact multiple parts of the file.

5. **Summary Judgment:** Based on the analysis, this file shows signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell due to the presence of repetitive or similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for significant impact from changes within the file. The `migrate()` method, in particular, stands out for its complexity and multiple points of interaction with other classes, suggesting that small changes in requirements could lead to many small edits across multiple places in both this file and potentially others."
Internet.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery 

Here are the answers to the given questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as generating different types of internet-related data (e.g., `emailAddress`, `safeEmailAddress`, `domainName`, `domainWord`, `domainSuffix`, etc.).

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the generation of random numbers or strings.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The evidence includes the presence of repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for significant change impact within the file."
AllMembersSupplier.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Yes**, the file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `addSinglePointFields`, `addMultiPointFields`, `addSinglePointMethods`, and `addMultiPointMethods`, which all update a list of `PotentialAssignment` objects.

2. **Yes**, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the `addArrayValues` and `addIterableValues` methods, which both iterate over a collection and add values to a list.

3. **Yes**, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially in the `getValueSources` method, which calls various other methods to add values to a list.

4. **Yes**, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `ParameterSignature` class were to change, it could affect the `addSinglePointFields`, `addMultiPointFields`, `addSinglePointMethods`, and `addMultiPointMethods` methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for many methods to be affected by a change in a business rule, data structure, or method signature."
AwtCodec.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. 

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, there are many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, such as the `parsePoint`, `parseRectangle`, `parseFont`, and `parseColor` methods, which all parse JSON data to create different AWT objects.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, the methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, including `SerializeWriter`, `JSONLexer`, `DefaultJSONParser`, and various AWT classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the JSON format for representing Point objects changed, the `parsePoint` method would need to be updated, as well as the `write` method that serializes Point objects. Similarly, if the AWT classes themselves changed, multiple methods in this file would need to be updated to reflect those changes.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery. The duplication of logic in the parsing methods, the widespread external interactions, and the potential impact of changes to business rules or data structures all contribute to this conclusion. A small change to the requirements, such as a change to the JSON format or the AWT classes, would require many small edits in multiple places, which is a hallmark of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating fewer methods in this file. For example, a change to the `RedisConnection` interface would likely only affect a few methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on my analysis, I did not find evidence of Shotgun Surgery in this file. The methods are relatively specialized, and there is no clear indication that a small change in requirements would require making many small, similar changes in multiple places across the codebase."
LinkedHashMultimap.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. The methods are unique and perform distinct operations.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic is mostly encapsulated within individual methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mostly with the `Multimap` interface and other related classes, and the interactions are necessary for the implementation of the `LinkedHashMultimap` class.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating some methods in this file. For example, if the `ValueEntry` class were to change, the `ValueSet` class would likely need to be updated as well. However, the impact would be limited to related classes and methods.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs of the ""Shotgun Surgery"" code smell. The methods and classes are well-encapsulated and organized, with minimal repetition and duplication. Any changes to the code would likely have a limited impact on the overall structure and organization of the class."
PropertyElf.java,"1. **NO**, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks in an obviously redundant manner, but there are some repetitive sections of code, for instance in the `setProperty` method, where there are multiple `else if` statements for handling different data types.

2. **YES**, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated, such as the code for `GetProperty` and `setProperty`, where both have to handle different getter and setter methods.

3. **YES**, methods in this file frequently interact with the `target` object's methods, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place (like adding a new getter or setter to `target`) would require similar changes in many methods within this class.

4. **YES**, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., adding a new data type that `setProperty` should support), it would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as modifying the `setProperty` method to handle this new type correctly.

5. **YES, I found Shotgun Surgery**. The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to the repetitive handling of different data types, the tight coupling between methods and the `target` object, and the potential for widespread changes in response to changes in the business logic or data structures.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. The interactions appear to be limited to the `JedisCluster` and `Jedis` classes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only a few methods in this file. For example, if the `JedisCluster` class changes, only the methods that directly interact with it would need to be updated. There are no examples of methods that would require widespread changes.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The logic is well-encapsulated, and changes to one part of the code are unlikely to have a ripple effect throughout the file."
RandomGenerator.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely only require updating a few methods in this file, such as the `generate` and `verify` methods.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are relatively simple and do not contain repetitive or duplicated logic. The interactions with external classes are also minimal and do not suggest widespread changes would be required."
RouterNanoHTTPD.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: While there are many methods that handle HTTP requests, such as `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete`, they are all part of an interface and do not seem to duplicate logic.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: The code does contain some duplicated logic, such as the `getStatus` and `getMimeType` methods in the various handler classes, but these are relatively simple and could be considered boilerplate code.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: The `RouterNanoHTTPD` class does interact with multiple handler classes, but this is by design and does not seem excessive.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating some methods in this file. For example, if the `UriResponder` interface were to change, all classes that implement it would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, the code does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery, as changes to business rules or data structures would likely be contained within specific classes or interfaces. While there may be some duplicated logic, it is relatively minor and does not seem to be a significant maintenance concern."
JavassistProxyFactory.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as generating proxy classes for different interfaces (e.g., Connection, Statement, PreparedStatement). The generateProxyClass method is called multiple times with different parameters to achieve this.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There are patterns where similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the way method bodies are generated and injected into proxy classes. The modifyProxyFactory method also contains repeated logic for setting the body of different methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Methods in this file interact with many different classes, including those from the java.sql package and the javassist library. While this interaction is necessary for the functionality of the class, it does suggest that changes in these external classes could require similar changes in multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods. For example, if the method signature of a java.sql interface method were to change, the generateProxyClass method would need to be updated to handle this change, which would then require changes to all the proxy classes generated by this method.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The repeated logic, similar methods, and widespread external interactions all contribute to this conclusion. Specifically, the generateProxyClass method and the modifyProxyFactory method contain logic that would need to be updated if the java.sql interfaces or the ProxyFactory class were to change."

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only a few methods in this file, such as the `parsePartitions`, `checkClusterState`, `checkSlaveNodesChange`, `checkMasterNodesChange`, `checkSlotsChange`, and `checkSlotsMigration` methods. However, these changes would be contained within a specific area of the code and would not have a ripple effect throughout the entire file.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The code appears to be well-organized and modular, with clear and distinct responsibilities for each method and class. While there may be some areas where changes could have a ripple effect, these changes would be contained within a specific area of the code and would not have a widespread impact."

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No, the methods in this file do not contain repeated logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Yes, this interface interacts with various classes such as Label, Type, and other classes that implement this interface, but it does not seem excessive.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
No, changes to data structures, business rules, or method signatures used in this file would likely require minimal updates within this file, primarily because it is an interface.

5. Summary Judgment:
There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places within this file. The methods in this interface are quite focused and distinct, and changes to the requirements would likely be contained within classes that implement this interface rather than the interface itself."
FlowControllerV1.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The `apiUpdateFlowRule` and `apiAddFlowRule` methods both contain repetitive validation code for the `FlowRuleEntity` object, such as checking for nulls and empty strings.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Similar logic for error handling and validation is repeated across the `apiQueryMachineRules`, `apiAddFlowRule`, `apiUpdateFlowRule`, and `apiDeleteFlowRule` methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
The `sentinelApiClient` and `repository` objects are widely used across multiple methods in this file, interacting with external dependencies. Changes to these external interactions could require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If the `FlowRuleEntity` class or its validation rules were to change, it would likely require updates to many methods in this file, such as `apiAddFlowRule`, `apiUpdateFlowRule`, and the `checkEntityInternal` method. For instance, if a new field were added to `FlowRuleEntity`, similar validation code would need to be added to the aforementioned methods.

5. Summary Judgment: 
The presence of repetitive validation code, error handling logic, and widespread interaction with external dependencies suggests that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the presence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. Specifically, the `FlowRuleEntity` validation and the use of `sentinelApiClient` and `repository` across multiple methods contribute to this smell. Refactoring to extract common logic and validation rules into separate methods or classes could help mitigate this issue."

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it is unlikely to require updating many methods. For example, a change to the `RuleEntry` class or the `ENTRY_COMPARATOR` would only affect the `getSortedEntries` method. 

5. Summary Judgment: There is no substantial evidence to suggest that this file would contribute significantly to the ""Shotgun Surgery"" code smell. The structure and logic are relatively contained, and potential changes to the system are likely to have localized impacts rather than necessitating widespread edits."
LocalCacheListener.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the detailed answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, the file contains several similar methods. For example, the `createCache` method creates different types of caches based on the `evictionPolicy`, which could be seen as repetitive.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, the same logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file. For instance, the checks for different `ReconnectionStrategy` and `SyncStrategy` are repeated in multiple places.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `RedissonTopic`, `RObject`, `CommandAsyncExecutor`, and others, which could suggest that a change in one place might require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for significant changes within the file if business rules or data structures are modified."
TransactionMQProducer.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, the file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as getting and setting properties like `transactionCheckListener`, `checkThreadPoolMinSize`, `checkThreadPoolMaxSize`, and `checkRequestHoldMax`, which could indicate a pattern that might be repeated across multiple files.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, the methods `sendMessageInTransaction` have similar logic, which is setting the topic of the message using `NamespaceUtil.wrapNamespace`. This repeated logic might be found in other classes or methods as well, indicating a potential for Shotgun Surgery.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, this class interacts with various external classes and interfaces, such as `DefaultMQProducer`, `TransactionCheckListener`, `TransactionListener`, and `ExecutorService`, suggesting that a change in one of these interactions could require similar changes in multiple places across the codebase.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule or method signature used in this file were to change, such as the way transactions are handled or the signature of `sendMessageInTransaction`, it could require updating multiple methods within this file. For example, changing the `TransactionSendResult` return type or the parameters of `sendMessageInTransaction` methods could affect several parts of the class.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of potential Shotgun Surgery. The repetition in getter and setter methods, the duplicated logic in `sendMessageInTransaction` methods, and the widespread interaction with external classes indicate that small changes could necessitate numerous updates across the codebase, aligning with the characteristics of Shotgun Surgery."
PlainPermissionManager.java,"1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** 
No, the file does not contain many repetitive or similar methods. Each method seems to be responsible for a specific task, and there is no apparent duplication of functionality.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** 
No, there are no obvious patterns of duplicated or repeated logic within the methods or classes in this file. The logic appears to be well-organized and each part of the code seems to have its specific responsibility.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** 
Yes, the methods in this file do interact with other classes, particularly in areas such as `AclUtils`, `Permission`, and `RemoteAddressStrategyFactory`. These interactions could potentially lead to shotgun surgery if changes to these external classes or interfaces were to occur.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** 
Yes, certain changes could require updates in multiple places within this file. For instance, if the structure of `PlainAccessConfig` or `PlainAccessResource` were to change, it's likely that multiple methods here would need adjustments. Similarly, if the logic for handling permissions or remote address strategies changes, that could also affect multiple parts of the code.

5. **Summary Judgment:** 
YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The evidence includes the dependency on external classes and interfaces, the potential for widespread impact from changes in certain data structures or logic (like permission handling), and the interactions with multiple external components. These factors suggest that a small change in requirements could indeed necessitate many small, similar edits across the codebase, including this file."
JSONTokener.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery 

However, I will provide the step-by-step analysis as requested:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** 
   - There are methods like `next()`, `next(int n)`, `next(char c)`, `nextClean()`, `nextString(char quote)`, `nextTo(char delimiter)`, `nextTo(String delimiters)`, `nextValue()`, and `skipTo(char to)` that seem to perform similar tasks, but they have distinct differences in their implementations and are not simply repetitive.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** 
   - Some logic, like error handling (e.g., throwing `JSONException`), is repeated across multiple methods, but this is typically seen as a necessary aspect of ensuring robust error handling and does not seem excessively duplicated.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** 
   - The class primarily interacts with `Reader`, `InputStream`, `JSONConfig`, and itself. While it does interact with several external classes, these interactions are largely necessary for its core functionality and are managed in a way that does not seem overly complex or indicative of Shotgun Surgery.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** 
   - If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it could require updating multiple methods. For example, if the way characters are read from the `Reader` changes, methods like `next()`, `nextClean()`, etc., might need to be updated. However, these changes seem more related to the class's internal logic rather than indicating a Shotgun Surgery code smell.

5. **Summary Judgment:** 
   - Based on the analysis, this file does not strongly exhibit signs of Shotgun Surgery. The methods and logic within the class seem well-structured and related to the core functionality of parsing JSON, without clear signs of repetitive or unnecessary complexity that would suggest a high risk of needing many small edits across multiple places in response to a single change in requirements."

TableView.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Here are my answers to the given questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: The provided Java file does contain methods that perform similar tasks. For instance, the `drawRow` and `drawSeparationLine` methods share similar logic for handling column data and formatting.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There are repeated patterns across multiple methods. For example, the `getData` and `drawRow` methods both handle the logic of retrieving and formatting column data. Additionally, the `borders` and `hasBorder` methods both deal with border-related logic.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Methods in this file interact with other classes, such as `ColumnDefine` and `Constants`, but the interactions are primarily focused on the table view's functionality. However, the `addRow` method interacts with the `ColumnDefine` class, which might suggest a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods if the `ColumnDefine` class is modified.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods. For example, if the `ColumnDefine` class's `getWidth` method were to change, the `drawRow` and `drawSeparationLine` methods would likely need to be updated as well. Another example is the `borders` and `hasBorder` methods, which would require updates if the border logic were to change.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on my analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes repetitive methods, duplicated logic, and widespread interactions with other classes. The change impact within the file is also significant, with many methods relying on specific logic and data structures."

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of Shotgun Surgery."
CompareObjectsSettings.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, the class contains many setter and getter methods that perform similar tasks, such as `setSkipSystemObjects` and `isSkipSystemObjects`. 

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, the logic for loading and saving settings in the `loadFrom` and `saveTo` methods is repetitive and could be improved.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, the `loadFrom` and `saveTo` methods interact with the `DBPSettingsSection` class in a way that suggests changes to the settings could require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, changes to the business rules or data structures used in this class (e.g., adding or removing a setting) would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, adding a new setting would require adding a new field, getter, setter, and updating the `loadFrom` and `saveTo` methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The class shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to the repetitive nature of the setter and getter methods, the duplicated logic in the `loadFrom` and `saveTo` methods, and the widespread external interactions with the `DBPSettingsSection` class. If a setting were to be added or removed, it would likely require updating multiple methods in this class."
InlineSizeHistoVisitable.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as handling different types of tags, but the methods like `processParseTag` and `handleOther` could potentially be similar across multiple classes if they are handling similar tag types.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as how different tag types are handled within the `processParseTag` method.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially considering the large number of constants being imported from `JITWatchConstants` which could imply a similar structure across multiple files.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the way `parseTag` children are processed changes, or if the `ATTR_NAME`, `ATTR_HOLDER`, `ATTR_BYTES` attributes are modified or replaced, the `processParseTag` method would need to be updated in several places.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the local patterns and structures found in this file, there are indications that could contribute to the Shotgun Surgery code smell if similar patterns exist across the codebase. The presence of repetitive logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential impact of changes within the file suggest that small changes in requirements could lead to many small edits in multiple places."

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file. The impact of changes seems to be localized to specific areas of the code.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, i.e., it does not exhibit the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The structure and organization of the code seem to minimize the need for widespread changes in response to small requirement changes."
ClientHead.java,"To analyze the provided Java file for symptoms of the ""Shotgun Surgery"" code smell, let's go through each question step by step:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:**
   - The `ClientHead` class contains several methods, but a closer look reveals that while there are many methods, they don't seem to be repetitive or trivially similar. Each method appears to serve a distinct purpose related to client management, communication, or state tracking. Thus, there's no strong indication of repetitive or similar methods that would hint at Shotgun Surgery.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:**
   - Upon inspecting the class, most of the logic is encapsulated within distinct methods, and there isn't an obvious duplication of logic across multiple methods. The class handles a variety of functionalities related to a client, including but not limited to, channel binding, packet sending, timeout scheduling, and connection management, but it does so in a manner that seems to avoid duplicating logic.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:**
   - The `ClientHead` class interacts with various other classes, such as `NamespaceClient`, `TransportState`, `AckManager`, `DisconnectableHub`, and `Store`, among others. While these interactions are necessary for its functionality and it doesn't seem excessively spreading across the class in a way that would indicate Shotgun Surgery, changes in these interactions or the classes they belong to could require adjustments in `ClientHead`.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:**
   - If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., how packets are sent or how disconnections are handled), it could indeed require updating multiple methods within this file. For example, if the way packets are sent changes, the `sendPackets` method and potentially `send` and `schedulePingTimeout` could need updates. This indicates a potential fragility to change, which could be a precursor to Shotgun Surgery if similar patterns are widespread across the codebase.

5. **Summary Judgment:**
   - Based on the analysis, there are hints of potential issues, particularly related to the impact of changes within the file and its interactions with other classes. However, the code seems well-structured and doesn't exhibit overt examples of the Shotgun Surgery smell within this single file. The methods are distinct, and logic isn't obviously duplicated. The primary concern would be how changes in this file or its dependencies might ripple through the codebase, but without examining the broader context, it's challenging to make a definitive judgment.

Given these considerations, the answer to the presence of Shotgun Surgery in this file, based on the provided information and focusing strictly on the patterns and structures within this one file, would be:

**NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery**

However, it's crucial to note that a complete assessment of Shotgun Surgery would require examining how this class interacts with the rest of the codebase and whether similar patterns of change sensitivity are present elsewhere."
Closer.java,"To analyze the given Java file for symptoms of the ""Shotgun Surgery"" code smell, let's go through the questions step by step.

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: 
   - The `rethrow` methods are similar in purpose but differ in parameters and handling of exceptions. 
   - The `Suppressor` implementations (`LoggingSuppressor` and `SuppressingSuppressor`) are distinct and don't exhibit repetition.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: 
   - The `rethrow` methods have some duplicated logic in terms of throwing an exception, but their logic is not entirely repetitive due to different parameters and handling.
   - No significant duplicated logic across methods or classes within this file that stands out.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: 
   - This class interacts with external classes (like `Closeable`, `IOException`, `RuntimeException`, etc.), but these are standard library interactions and not particularly indicative of a Shotgun Surgery issue.
   - The class does not exhibit frequent, overly complex interactions with many different classes that would suggest a Shotgun Surgery problem.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: 
   - If the business rule regarding how exceptions are handled changes, it could impact multiple methods (`rethrow`, `close`, and `suppress` methods in the `Suppressor` implementations).
   - A change in the way `Closeable` resources are registered or closed could affect the `register` and `close` methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: 
   - Based on the analysis, there isn't considerable evidence to strongly indicate that this file, on its own, is suffering from the Shotgun Surgery code smell. While there are areas where changes could require updates in multiple places, these seem well-encapsulated within the class's responsibilities and are not overly burdensome in terms of maintenance.

Given this analysis, the conclusion would be: 

NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. 

The code, as presented, appears well-structured and focused on managing closeable resources and exception handling in a manner consistent with good object-oriented design principles. Changes to requirements may necessitate updates in specific areas, but these are contained and manageable within the context of this class."
Tokeniser.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Although there are several `emit` methods with different parameters, they serve distinct purposes.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it is unlikely to require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `TokeniserState` class were to change, it would likely require updating the `state` field and the `transition` method. However, the impact would be contained within a few methods, and there is no evidence of widespread duplication or similar logic.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The code appears to be well-organized, and changes to the requirements would likely be contained within specific methods or classes."

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mostly internal or with standard Java library classes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a few methods in this file, but not many. For example, if the `MULTIPART_FORM_DATA_HEADER` constant were to change, it would require updates in the constructor and the `isMultipart` method.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on my analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of Shotgun Surgery. The code is relatively self-contained and well-structured, suggesting that changes would be localized and manageable."

No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes, in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, the `ResultLoaderMap` class encapsulates its own state and behavior, and changes to its internal implementation would not affect other parts of the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
The `ResultLoaderMap` class and its inner classes do not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The class has a clear and focused purpose, and its internal implementation is cohesive and self-contained. While it does interact with other classes and interfaces, these interactions are limited and well-defined, and do not suggest a high degree of coupling or fragility."
HikariConfig.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as getters and setters for various properties. These methods are repetitive in nature and could be considered similar.

The changes to property names, validation logic, or even the addition of a new property would also have a broad impact.

5. **Summary Judgment**: This file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the presence of many similar getter and setter methods, repeated logic for validation and checking, widespread interactions with other classes, and a broad impact of changes to business rules or method signatures within the file. The file's design and structure suggest that it is prone to Shotgun Surgery, making maintenance and updates more challenging than necessary."

2. **No**, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic in each method is unique.

3. **No**, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mostly with classes within the same package or other closely related classes (e.g., `Dictionary`, `AnalysisIkPlugin`).

4. **No**, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely not require updating many methods in this file. For example, a change to the `useSmart` field would only affect the `isUseSmart()` and `setUseSmart()` methods.

5. **Summary**: Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are relatively simple and self-contained, with minimal repetition or duplication of logic."
VCardResultParser.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Yes, the file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `matchVCardPrefixedField` and `matchSingleVCardPrefixedField`, which have similar logic but differ in their parameters.

2. Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the use of regular expressions and string manipulation in `matchVCardPrefixedField` and `decodeQuotedPrintable`.

3. Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially with regards to string manipulation and parsing, which suggests that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the format of the VCard data were to change, many of the methods that parse this data would need to be updated.

5. The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to the presence of many similar methods, repeated logic, and widespread external interactions. A small change in requirements, such as a change in the VCard format, would likely require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the numerous methods that perform similar tasks, the repeated use of regular expressions and string manipulation, and the many interactions with different classes."
InterceptorProcessor.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are methods like `errorHandler` and the main `process` method that contain similar logic for pushing bindings onto the stack and handling method invocations.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are repeated patterns for handling bindings, checking types, and invoking methods, which could be extracted into separate methods for better maintainability.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, the `InterceptorProcessor` interacts with multiple classes, such as `MethodProcessor`, `BindingContext`, `StackSaver`, and `InsnList`, which could require changes in multiple places if any of these classes change.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `Binding` class changes, all the methods that use it would need to be updated. Similarly, if the logic for handling exceptions changes, both the `process` method and the `errorHandler` method would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests that this file is prone to Shotgun Surgery. The presence of similar methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions makes it likely that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. Additionally, the complexity of the `process` method and the tight coupling between classes increase the risk of Shotgun Surgery.

However, as with any complex class, changes to certain methods or data structures could still have a ripple effect."
StpLogic.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `getTokenValue()`, `getTokenValueNotCut()`, `getTokenInfo()`, `getSession()`, `getTokenSession()`, `checkLogin()`, `checkRole()`, `checkPermission()`, `login()`, `logout()`, `kickout()`, `replaced()`, `disable()`, `untieDisable()`, `openSafe()`, `closeSafe()`, `checkSafe()`. These methods seem to be related to token management, session management, login, logout, and permission checking.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the token validation logic in `getTokenValue()`, `getTokenValueNotCut()`, `getTokenInfo()`, and `checkLogin()`. 

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially `SaManager`, `SaTokenDao`, `SaSession`, `SaTokenConfig`, and `SaStrategy`. A change in one place might require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the token validation logic changes, it would require updates in `getTokenValue()`, `getTokenValueNotCut()`, `getTokenInfo()`, and `checkLogin()`. 

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The evidence includes repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high impact of changes within the file. Refactoring this code to reduce the shotgun surgery smell could involve extracting common logic into separate methods, reducing the number of external interactions, and introducing more abstraction to make the code more modular and easier to maintain."
QueueTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the step-by-step answers:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. The methods appear to be test cases with different scenarios and assertions.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** No, there is no apparent duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic within each method is distinct and serves a specific purpose in testing the Queue class.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. The interactions are primarily with the Queue class being tested and JUnit assertions.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updates to specific test methods, but the impact would likely be contained within those directly affected test cases. For example, changes to the Queue class's addLast or removeFirst methods might require updates to test cases that specifically test these methods.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The organization and structure of the test cases are straightforward and focused on specific aspects of the Queue class's functionality."
DetectionResultRowIndicatorColumn.java,"1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, there are methods like `adjustCompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers` and `adjustIncompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers` that have similar tasks, such as iterating through codewords and updating row numbers. There's also some repetition in calculating row indicators and metadata values.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, there are duplicated patterns in methods like `adjustCompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers` and `adjustIncompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers`, and also in the `getBarcodeMetadata` method where row indicators and metadata values are calculated. The switch statements in `getBarcodeMetadata` and `removeIncorrectCodewords` also have similar logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, methods in this file interact with many different classes, such as `Codeword`, `BarcodeMetadata`, `BarcodeValue`, `BoundingBox`, and `ResultPoint`. Changes to these classes could require similar changes in multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the calculation of row indicators or metadata values changes, it would impact multiple methods like `adjustCompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers`, `adjustIncompleteIndicatorColumnRowNumbers`, and `getBarcodeMetadata`.

5. Summary Judgment: YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The evidence includes repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and high change impact within the file. This suggests that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the presence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** Yes, there are several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `buildResultMapping` and `buildParameterMapping`, which have similar method signatures and logic.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** Yes, there are patterns where similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the `applyCurrentNamespace` method being called in multiple places.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `Configuration`, `Cache`, and `TypeHandler`, which could suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `Configuration` class were to change, it would likely require updates to methods like `addMappedStatement` and `addResultMap`.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The evidence suggests that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. This is due to the repetitive and similar methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions present in the file. Additionally, the fact that many methods rely on the `Configuration` class and other external classes means that changes to these classes would have a ripple effect throughout the file."
BuildCommand.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery


Here are the detailed answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: 
   There are no many repetitive methods. Each method seems to have its own responsibility, like `run()`, `printUsageSummary()`, etc.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**:
   No patterns of repeated or very similar logic are found in multiple methods within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**:
   Yes, the `run()` method interacts with different classes in various ways, e.g., it uses `Jenkins.getAuthentication2()`, `StreamTaskListener`, `Job`, `SCMTriggerItem`, etc.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**:
   If some business rule or method signature changed, e.g., the `Job` class, it might require updating only the parts of the `run()` method that deal with it, not necessarily requiring updates in many methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**:
   Based on this analysis, there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places in this file, i.e., Shotgun Surgery is not detected in this file."
FrameworkField.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the step-by-step answers:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No, there are no many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks in this file.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely only require updating a few methods in this file.

5. Summary Judgment: 
This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery), as there are no repetitive or similar methods, no duplicated or repeated logic, and methods interact with only a few other classes."
CmsSubjectCategoryExample.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
There are many similar methods that perform checks for null values and set conditions, but these seem to be part of a larger framework for building database queries. They are all related to the same purpose and follow a consistent pattern, suggesting they might not lead to Shotgun Surgery issues directly.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic in the addCriterion methods with different parameters, but it's all about adding different types of criteria to the query, which doesn't seem like duplicated logic in the context of this class's purpose.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
This class seems to primarily interact with its own internal classes and attributes, without a large number of external class interactions that would suggest Shotgun Surgery.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a field or method in this file were to change (e.g., a new field added to the criteria), it could require updates in several places, especially in the addCriterion methods and the various Criteria classes. For instance, adding a new field would likely require new methods similar to andIdEqualTo or andNameEqualTo. However, given the structured and systematic way these are implemented, this doesn't necessarily indicate Shotgun Surgery as the changes are localized and follow a clear pattern.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does contain patterns where similar logic is applied across multiple methods (like the addCriterion methods and the numerous and*EqualTo methods), but given the context and purpose of this class (seemingly part of a database query builder), these repetitions seem part of a design choice rather than symptoms of Shotgun Surgery. The design is consistent and systematic, which is different from the scattered and unrelated changes that typically characterize Shotgun Surgery."
GsonBuilder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose and is part of the builder pattern, which makes the code organized and easy to follow.
2. There are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. Each method has its unique implementation and does not seem to have duplicate logic.
3. The methods in this file do interact with other classes, but these interactions are limited and seem necessary for the functionality of the builder. 
4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating some methods in this file. However, the change would likely be contained within a specific area of the code, and the impact would be localized. For example, if the date format were to change, the `setDateFormat` methods might need to be updated.
5. Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs of Shotgun Surgery, as the methods and structure seem organized and easy to maintain. The builder pattern and the clear separation of responsibilities between methods make it less likely for a small change in requirements to require many small edits in multiple places."

   No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   If a business rule or method signature used in this file were to change, it may require some updates, such as changing the way `opcodeInvokeCountMap` is used or updating the `count` method. For example, if the `BytecodeInstruction` class changes, the `processInstructions` and `count` methods would need to be updated. However, the impact is relatively contained within a few methods.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the structure and logic are relatively straightforward and self-contained."
AbstractSentinelAspectSupport.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar tasks. While there are multiple methods related to handling fallbacks and block handlers, each method has a distinct purpose and is not simply a repetition of another method.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
No, there is no repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic for handling fallbacks, block handlers, and method resolution is encapsulated within specific methods, and no method contains duplicate code.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. The interactions are mostly confined to the classes within the same package or closely related packages, and the interactions are specific to the functionality being implemented.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updates in a few related methods, such as those involved in handling fallbacks or block handlers. For example, if the `SentinelResource` annotation were to change, the methods `handleFallback` and `handleBlockException` might need updates. However, these changes would be localized to specific parts of the file rather than requiring widespread updates throughout the file.

5. Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that would indicate a small change in requirements would necessarily require many small edits in multiple places, which is a characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The organization and encapsulation of logic within specific methods contribute to the file's maintainability and reduce the likelihood of widespread changes being required for small modifications."
SaTokenConfig.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, many setter and getter methods in this class are repetitive and perform similar tasks.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods (e.g., the setter methods).

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, some methods like `getCookie()` and `setCookie()` interact with other objects (like `SaCookieConfig`), which could indicate a change in one place might require similar changes in many methods if this pattern is repeated elsewhere.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, a change in business rules or data structures in this file (for example, changing how `timeout` is calculated or adding a new type of token style) could require updating many methods within this file, especially the getters and setters.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests this file shows signs that a small change in requirements could require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the presence of Shotgun Surgery. The repetition and similarity in methods, along with interactions that could trigger widespread changes, support this conclusion. Specifically, the extensive use of getter and setter methods for numerous configuration options, and interactions with other configuration objects, could mean that altering any one of these configurations might necessitate adjustments across the board, mirroring the Shotgun Surgery pattern."

Selectable.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
There are multiple methods that perform similar tasks, such as `xpath`, `$`, `css`, `regex`, and others that extract or select data in different ways, but with similar method structures.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There are method pairs like `$(String selector)` and `css(String selector)` that seem to do essentially the same thing with different parameter names, suggesting repeated logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Methods in this interface interact with various external concepts, such as XPath, CSS selectors, regular expressions, and JSON paths, suggesting that changes in any of these areas could affect multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If a business rule, such as how data is extracted or selected, were to change, it could likely require updating many methods in this interface. For example, if the logic for handling CSS selectors needed to change, both the `$(String selector)` and `css(String selector)` methods would need to be updated, along with their overloaded versions that include attribute names.

5. Summary Judgment: 
This interface shows signs of Shotgun Surgery because many of its methods perform similar tasks, there are duplications in logic (like the `$` and `css` methods), and changes in how data is extracted or selected could ripple through many parts of this interface, requiring widespread updates. This suggests that a small change in requirements could indeed require many small edits in multiple places."

The methods and logic are well-structured and contained within specific responsibilities, minimizing the impact of changes across the class."
DataFormatter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   - The file does contain some methods with similar names and purposes, such as `getFormat` and `createFormat`, which both seem to handle the creation of formats. However, they seem to serve slightly different purposes and aren't repetitive in the classical sense.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   - The code does contain some repeated logic, such as the use of regular expressions in `colorPattern`, `localePatternGroup`, `fractionPattern`, etc. However, this repetition is somewhat unavoidable due to the nature of the task, which involves working with various formats and parsing rules.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   - Some methods in this file do interact with external classes, but these interactions are relatively limited and well-contained. The class does seem to have a focused responsibility.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   - If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it's possible that updates would be required in multiple places, especially given the complexity and variety of formats being handled. However, the impact would likely be contained within this file or closely related ones, as the class is focused on formatting and parsing.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   - While this file is complex and does contain some repetitive or similar code, it doesn't exhibit strong symptoms of Shotgun Surgery, as the changes required due to a modification in requirements would likely be contained within this file or closely related ones. The code seems well-structured to handle the variety of formats and parsing rules, and any repetition or duplication seems to be a necessary aspect of handling these formats."

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.
2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file.
3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.
4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely not require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the data structure of `AccessTokenModel` were to change, it might require updating some methods like `toLineMap()`, but the impact is relatively contained within a few related methods.
5. Based on my analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, characteristic of Shotgun Surgery. The methods and logic in this file are relatively self-contained and focused on the `AccessTokenModel` class."
NiceSecurePasswordField.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. The file contains several methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, such as the ""Passthrough"" methods (`getText`, `textProperty`, `getCharacters`, `setPassword`, `wipe`, `selectAll`, `selectRange`) which simply forward calls to the `passwordField` object.

2. Patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file can be observed in the initialization of the `capsLockedIcon`, `nonPrintableCharsIcon`, and `revealPasswordIcon` objects, which all have similar binding and property settings.

3. Methods in this file frequently interact with the `passwordField` object, as well as other classes like `FontAwesome5IconView` and `ToggleButton`, suggesting that a change in one place (e.g., the `passwordField` object) would require similar changes in many methods.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., the `passwordField` object's methods or properties), it would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as the ""Passthrough"" methods and the binding logic for the icons.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The evidence includes repetitive ""Passthrough"" methods, repeated logic in icon initialization, and widespread interactions with other classes, all of which suggest that changes to the `passwordField` object or other dependencies would require multiple updates throughout the file."
GeometryViewerRegistry.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains methods that perform similar tasks, such as `getPredefinedLeafletTiles()` and `getUserDefinedLeafletTiles()`, both of which return lists of `LeafletTilesDescriptor` objects after synchronizing access.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where similar logic is repeated, for example, the logic for reading and writing XML configuration files appears in both `populateFromConfig()` and `flushConfig()` methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with external classes and interfaces, particularly those related to the Eclipse platform (e.g., `IExtensionRegistry`, `IConfigurationElement`) and the `GISViewerActivator`. Changes in these external classes could necessitate changes in multiple methods within this file.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating several methods. For instance, if the structure of the `LeafletTilesDescriptor` were to change, this could impact multiple places where this class is used (e.g., in `updateTiles()`, `setDefaultLeafletTiles()`, `flushConfig()`).

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests that this file exhibits symptoms of Shotgun Surgery, primarily due to the repetition in logic for handling similar data structures, the widespread interaction with external classes, and the likelihood that changes in business rules or data structures would necessitate updates across multiple methods within the file. This could lead to maintenance challenges, where small changes in requirements could result in the need for numerous small edits across the codebase."

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `CopyOptions`, `ValueProvider`, and `BeanUtil`, which could suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example:
   - If the `CopyOptions` class were to change, multiple methods in this file would need to be updated to reflect those changes.
   - If the logic for handling ignored properties or null values were to change, that change would need to be applied in several methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the presence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. This is due to the repetitive and similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for widespread changes within the file due to modifications in external classes or business rules."

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Some changes could impact multiple parts of the file, such as changes to the HTTPSession class or the NanoHTTPD class. For example, if the.HTTPSession class's execute() method were to change, it could require updating the run() method in this file.

5. Summary Judgment: 
This file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While some changes could impact multiple parts of the file, the file is relatively simple and does not contain repetitive or similar logic that would suggest a high risk of Shotgun Surgery."
DefaultJedisSocketFactory.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, the methods in this file are quite specific to the task of creating a socket for Redis connections and do not exhibit repetitive or similar tasks that could be simplified or extracted.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there is no apparent duplicated logic within this file. Each method focuses on a specific aspect of socket creation, configuration, or management, without repeating logic found in other methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file interact with several different classes (e.g., `Socket`, `SSLSocketFactory`, `SSLParameters`, `HostnameVerifier`), but these interactions are necessary for creating and configuring a socket for secure communication with Redis. However, this alone does not indicate Shotgun Surgery without other evidence.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule or method signature related to socket configuration or creation were to change, it might require updating a few methods in this file, particularly those directly involved in socket creation and configuration. However, this impact seems contained and specific to the functionality of creating and managing Redis sockets, rather than indicating a broader, Shotgun Surgery-like issue.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The methods and classes are well-defined, specific to their purpose, and do not exhibit the kind of redundancy or dispersal that would suggest Shotgun Surgery."
CronExpression.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `getSet` for different time units (SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, etc.) and the numerous `if` statements in the `buildExpression` method that parse different parts of the cron expression.

The file does interact with other classes, such as UnpooledDataSource and DriverManager, but these interactions are generally limited to specific areas of functionality and do not seem excessive.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If certain business rules, data structures, or method signatures used in this file were to change, it's possible that multiple methods might need to be updated. For example, changes to the way connections are managed could affect several methods. However, this does not necessarily indicate a Shotgun Surgery smell without more context.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the provided file, there is no clear indication of a Shotgun Surgery smell. While there are some areas where changes could potentially ripple through multiple methods, this does not seem excessive or indicative of a deeper design issue."
EmbedServer.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   The EmbedHttpServerHandler class contains several if-else statements in the process method that perform similar tasks, forwarding the request to different methods of the executorBiz object. This could be an indication of repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   Yes, there is repeated logic in the process method, where each condition in the if-else statement performs similar validation and execution tasks.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   The EmbedHttpServerHandler class interacts with the executorBiz object, which could be an indication of widespread external interactions if this pattern is present in other classes as well.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   If the ExecutorBiz interface or its implementing class were to change, it could potentially require updates in multiple methods within this file, especially in the EmbedHttpServerHandler class.

5. Summary Judgment:
   Based on the presence of similar if-else statements, repetitive validation, and widespread external interactions, it appears that a small change in requirements could require multiple small edits in this file, indicating the presence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. Specifically, changes to the executorBiz object or its methods could necessitate updates in the EmbedHttpServerHandler class, which exhibits repetitive or similar tasks."
SentinelDubboConsumerFilter.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are methods like `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke` that perform similar tasks, such as invoking the `invoker` and handling exceptions.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, the logic for tracing entries and exiting entries is repeated in both `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke` methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, this class interacts with several external classes, such as `DubboUtils`, `SphU`, `Tracer`, and `DubboAdapterGlobalConfig`, which could suggest that changes in one place might require similar changes in multiple methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if the `DubboAdapterGlobalConfig` or `SphU` were to change, it would likely require updating both `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke` methods, as they both rely on these classes. For example, if the `getDubboConsumerResNamePrefixKey` method in `DubboAdapterGlobalConfig` were to change, both `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke` would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: This file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to the repetition of similar logic in multiple methods, the reliance on external interactions, and the potential for widespread changes within the file if certain business rules or data structures were to change. The repetition of exception handling and entry tracing logic in `syncInvoke` and `asyncInvoke` methods is a clear indication of this smell."
QueryParser.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** Yes, this file contains several methods that seem to perform similar tasks, such as `indexLessThan()`, `indexGreaterThan()`, `indexEquals()`, which all consume an index and add an evaluator to the list.
2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** Yes, there are repeated patterns of logic, for example, in `cssNthChild()` and its related `if-else` statements that determine whether it's `ofType` or `backwards`.
3. **Widespread External Interactions:** Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `Evaluator`, `TokenQueue`, and `Pattern`, which could suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.
4. **Change Impact Within the File:** Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the syntax for pseudo-selectors like `:lt`, `:gt`, `:eq` changes, the related methods would all need updates.
5. **Summary Judgment:** The file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery because it contains many similar methods, repeated logic, and interactions with numerous classes, suggesting that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods for handling pseudo-selectors, such as `indexLessThan()`, `indexGreaterThan()`, and `indexEquals()`, and the `cssNthChild()` method with its related conditional statements, demonstrate these characteristics. A change in the syntax or behavior of any of these pseudo-selectors would likely require updates across multiple methods, exhibiting the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
HikariDataSource.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Most methods seem to have distinct responsibilities and are not simply forwarding calls or updating similar fields.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, I did not find patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The methods appear to be well-structured and each has its own purpose.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with the `HikariPool` class, but this is a design choice given the purpose of the `HikariDataSource` class. This interaction is not necessarily indicative of Shotgun Surgery, as it is a deliberate and necessary part of the implementation.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating several methods in this file, especially those that interact with `HikariPool`. For example, if the `HikariPool` class's constructor or `getConnection` method signature changes, the `HikariDataSource` class would need to be updated accordingly. However, this is a normal part of maintaining code and is not necessarily a sign of Shotgun Surgery.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are interactions with `HikariPool` and potential update points, these seem to be part of a well-considered design rather than indicative of a code smell. The methods are generally distinct and well-structured, without significant repetition or duplicated logic."

2. No, there are no obvious patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, such as the logic for excluding classes or fields, it would likely require updating a few key methods, like `excludeClass` and `excludeField`.

5. Based on the provided file, the evidence does not strongly suggest Shotgun Surgery: No repetitive methods, duplicated logic, or widespread external interactions contribute to the type of coupling that would necessitate many small edits in multiple places due to a small change in requirements.

Since the evidence does not strongly suggest Shotgun Surgery: 
NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery."
JedisClusterCommand.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `run(String key)`, `run(int keyCount, String... keys)`, `runBinary(byte[] key)`, and `runBinary(int keyCount, byte[]... keys)`, which all call `runWithRetries(int slot)` with different key types and counts.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, the repeated logic can be seen in the `run` and `runBinary` methods, which have similar logic for handling single and multiple keys, and in the `handleConnectionProblem` method, which has a special case for `maxAttempts < 3`.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with the `JedisClusterConnectionHandler` class, especially in the `runWithRetries` method, which suggests that a change in `JedisClusterConnectionHandler` would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., the `JedisClusterConnectionHandler` class), it would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as the `run` and `runWithRetries` methods. For example, if the `JedisClusterCRC16.getSlot` method were to change, it would require updating all the methods that use it.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The evidence includes repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high change impact within the file."
TestConnections.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the detailed answers to the questions:
1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: The provided file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. The methods in the file are focused on testing different aspects of the `HikariDataSource` and do not show a repetitive pattern.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There is no apparent duplication of logic across multiple methods or classes within this file. Each test method seems to test a unique scenario and does not contain repeated logic.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Methods in this file do interact with other classes, but these interactions seem necessary for the testing purpose and do not suggest a widespread external interaction that would indicate Shotgun Surgery.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating some methods in this file, but the impact seems limited to specific test cases rather than a broad requirement for many small edits. For example, a change in `HikariConfig` might require updating methods that test its functionality, but this does not indicate a Shotgun Surgery pattern since these updates would be related to the specific functionality being tested.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs of Shotgun Surgery. The test methods are designed to cover various scenarios related to `HikariDataSource`, and while they do interact with multiple classes and configurations, the interactions and logic are specific to the testing requirements and do not demonstrate a pattern that would suggest Shotgun Surgery."

5. **Summary Judgment**: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are mostly simple getters and there is no evident duplicated logic or widespread external interactions."
ResizeController.java,"1. **YES**: There are many methods (e.g., `resizeTopLeft`, `resizeTopRight`, `resizeBottomLeft`, `resizeBottomRight`, `resizeTop`, `resizeLeft`, `resizeBottom`, `resizeRight`) that perform similar tasks related to resizing the window.

2. **YES**: Similar logic for checking the validity of new window dimensions is repeated across multiple methods (e.g., `resizeTop`, `resizeLeft`, `resizeBottom`, `resizeRight`).

3. **YES**: Methods in this file frequently interact with the `window` object and the `settings` object, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place (e.g., changing how window size or position is stored or calculated) would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **YES**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., changing how window sizes are stored or validated), it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the validation rules for window dimensions change, methods like `resizeTop`, `resizeLeft`, `resizeBottom`, `resizeRight` would all need to be updated.

5. **YES**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which indicates the presence of Shotgun Surgery.

The `pushWhenNoDuplicate` method and the `poll` method both interact with the Redis database using the Jedis client in a similar way (e.g., `jedis.zadd`, `jedis.lpush`, `jedis.zrevrange`), and the `getRequest` method has repeated logic for retrieving the URL.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Many methods in this file interact with the Jedis client, which suggests that a change in the Jedis client or Redis database interaction would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If the `Request` or `Task` class were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as `pushWhenNoDuplicate`, `poll`, `setExtrasInItem`, and `getExtrasInItem`. Additionally, if the Redis database interaction logic were to change, it would also require updating many methods.

5. Summary Judgment: 
This file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to repetitive or similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for widespread changes within the file. The evidence includes the similarity between the key construction methods, the repeated logic in the `pushWhenNoDuplicate` and `poll` methods, and the frequent interaction with the Jedis client."

   YES, the logic inside the getter methods (e.g., checking `shouldLoad()` and then calling `update()`) is repeated across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   NO, this file does not show frequent interactions with many different classes that would suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   YES, if the logic of `shouldLoad()` or the method signature of `update()` were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file, specifically all the getter methods that call these.

5. Summary Judgment:
   YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The evidence includes repetitive or similar methods (getter methods), duplicated or repeated logic within these methods, and the potential for a change in one part (e.g., `shouldLoad()` or `update()`) to impact many other parts (all the getter methods)."
MinMaxPriorityQueue.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:
1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** This file does contain many similar methods, especially in the `Heap` class, such as `bubbleUpAlternatingLevels`, `findMinChild`, and `findMinGrandChild`, that perform similar tasks. However, they are part of a cohesive implementation of a min-max priority queue, so this is not necessarily a sign of Shotgun Surgery.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** I found some duplicated logic in methods like `pollFirst` and `pollLast`, but it is generally encapsulated and reused within the class. The code attempts to minimize duplication and follows best practices, so this does not indicate Shotgun Surgery.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** The class has a clear and focused set of methods that interact with it, without broad, fragmented, or complicated interactions that are characteristic of Shotgun Surgery.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** While some changes, like altering the `comparator` used in the `MinMaxPriorityQueue`, might require updates in multiple places, the class is designed to handle such changes locally and internally, without propagating the impact to a wide range of other classes or methods. This is an example of encapsulation rather than Shotgun Surgery.

5. **Summary Judgment:** Considering the focused functionality, encapsulation, and minimization of duplicated code, I do not find evidence of Shotgun Surgery in this file. It adheres to sound object-oriented design principles and avoids the scatter-shot changes that are indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
MapDeserializer.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `deserialze` and `parseMap`, which have similar logic for parsing JSON objects into maps.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the `createMap` method which has multiple conditions to create different types of maps.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `DefaultJSONParser`, `JSONLexer`, `ParserConfig`, and various map classes, which suggests that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `JSONToken` enum were to change, it would require updates in multiple places where `JSONToken` values are used.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the presence of repetitive and similar methods, duplicated code, widespread external interactions, and a high impact of changes within the file. These factors contribute to the ""Shotgun Surgery"" code smell, indicating that the code may be brittle and difficult to maintain."

2. There are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file. Each constructor has a specific purpose and calls the superclass constructor with different parameters.

3. Methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The class only extends the Exception class and does not have any other external interactions.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely not require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the constructor signature of the superclass Exception were to change, only the three constructors in this file would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The class has a simple structure, and potential changes would have limited impact within the file."

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs of Shotgun Surgery, as there are no repetitive methods, duplicated logic, or widespread external interactions that would require many small edits in multiple places if a change were made. The changes would likely be isolated and minimal."
ParentRunnerTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. While there are some similar methods (e.g., `assertClassHasFailureMessage`), they are not repetitive in a way that suggests Shotgun Surgery.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic is mostly distinct and specific to each test method.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. The interactions are mostly with JUnit-specific classes and are not overly complex or widespread.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it is unlikely to require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `JUnitCore` class were to change, it would likely affect only a few methods that directly interact with it. However, the impact is mostly localized and does not suggest widespread changes.

5. **Summary Judgment:** Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The code is mostly organized and focused on specific test cases, with minimal repetition or widespread interactions that would suggest Shotgun Surgery."
NumberTest.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are many test methods that perform similar tasks, such as `testRandomDigit`, `testRandomDigitNotZero`, `testRandomNumber`, etc. These methods all test different aspects of the `Number` class, but they have similar structures and test similar logic.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are repeated patterns of logic across multiple methods. For example, many methods use a similar pattern of generating a random number and then asserting that it is within a certain range.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, many methods in this file interact with the `faker.number()` class, which is an external class. Changes to this external class would likely require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods. For example, if the `faker.number()` class were to change its method signature, many of the test methods would need to be updated to match.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery. There are many repetitive and similar methods, repeated patterns of logic, and widespread interactions with an external class. If a change were to be made to the external class or to a business rule, it would likely require many small edits in multiple places. Specific examples include the repeated use of `faker.number()` and the similar patterns of logic in the test methods. The `randomizationQualityTest` method is also a good example, as it is called by multiple test methods and performs a similar task each time."

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. The interactions are mostly with a few specific classes from the Eclipse framework.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it is unlikely to require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `enableHostEditorKeyBindings` method signature were to change, only that method and possibly its callers would need to be updated. However, if the `AbstractTextEditor` class were to change, it could potentially affect the `enableHostEditorKeyBindings` and `FakeTextEditor` classes.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating that the Shotgun Surgery code smell is not present. The file is mostly composed of utility methods that interact with a few specific classes, and the logic is not duplicated or repetitive."

5. Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, i.e., Shotgun Surgery, due to its modular design and encapsulation of similar functionality within specific methods or classes."
SMSParsedResult.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the methods in this file seem to have distinct purposes.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the null checks and the building of strings using `StringBuilder`.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, this file does not seem to interact with many different classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, for example, if the logic for constructing the `getSMSURI` string were to change, it might also require updating the logic in the `getDisplayResult` method, and possibly other methods if they also construct similar strings. Additionally, if the fields `numbers`, `vias`, `subject`, or `body` were to change, it would likely require updating multiple methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The presence of similar logic patterns, potential for widespread changes to string construction methods, and the reliance on specific field structures indicate that this file could exhibit symptoms of Shotgun Surgery if similar patterns are found in other files. Specifically, changes to the construction of the `getSMSURI` or the display logic could have a ripple effect, requiring multiple small edits across the codebase."
AnnotationScanner.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, the `select` method does not interact with many different classes. It only uses a few utility classes like `StringBuilder`, `ArrayList`, and `Arrays`.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, a change in the business rule or data structure used in the `select` method (like the threshold or block width) would likely require updating only this method, not many methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The logic is mostly contained within the `select` method, and a change in requirements would likely only affect this method, not multiple methods or classes."
Faker.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** Yes, this file contains many methods (accessor methods) that perform similar tasks, such as returning instances of various classes (e.g., `ancient()`, `app()`, `artist()`, etc.).

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the `instance()` methods that construct `Faker` instances with different parameters.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, which suggests that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `FakeValuesService` class were to change, many of the methods in the `Faker` class would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery. The large number of similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and potential for widespread changes all contribute to this conclusion. If a small change in requirements were to occur, it would likely require many small edits in multiple places."
ConstructorConstructor.java,"1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, there are several methods such as `newDefaultImplementationConstructor`, `newDefaultConstructor`, and `newUnsafeAllocator` that return an instance of `ObjectConstructor<T>` and perform similar tasks like creating instances of different types.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, some of the logic for creating instances of different types is repeated across multiple anonymous classes within the `newDefaultImplementationConstructor` method.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, this class interacts with `ReflectionAccessor` and `UnsafeAllocator`, which could potentially lead to widespread changes if either of these classes were to change significantly.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, changes to `TypeToken`, `InstanceCreator`, `ObjectConstructor`, `ReflectionAccessor`, or `UnsafeAllocator` could require updating many parts of this file, particularly in the `get`, `newDefaultImplementationConstructor`, `newDefaultConstructor`, and `newUnsafeAllocator` methods.

5. Summary Judgment: 
YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The file contains repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and potential for significant change impacts within the file, indicating that a small change in requirements could require many small edits in multiple places."
StatisticSlot.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. The file does contain some methods that perform similar tasks, such as updating node statistics in `entry` and `exit` methods. However, it's not excessively repetitive within this file.

2. Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple sections of code within this file. For example, the logic for updating node statistics (e.g., `node.increaseThreadNum()`, `node.addPassRequest(count)`) is repeated in multiple places.

3. Yes, methods in this file interact with several different classes, especially when considering the handling of different types of exceptions and the notification of various callback handlers. Changes in the behavior of these exceptions or handlers could potentially require updates in multiple methods.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating multiple methods. For example, if the way node statistics are updated changes, it would require updates in both the `entry` and `exit` methods, as well as the `recordCompleteFor` method. Similarly, changes to how exceptions are handled or how callback handlers are notified could require updates across the `entry` and `exit` methods.

5. Summary Judgment: The evidence from the repetition of similar logic, the interaction with various classes, and the potential impact of changes to business rules or data structures suggests that a small change in requirements could indeed require many small edits in multiple places within this file and potentially across the codebase, indicating the presence of Shotgun Surgery."
HttpConnection.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many similar methods that perform small or repetitive tasks. For example, the `url`, `proxy`, `userAgent`, `timeout`, `maxBodySize`, `followRedirects`, `referrer`, `method`, `ignoreHttpErrors`, `ignoreContentType`, `data`, `data`, `header`, `headers`, `cookie`, and `cookies` methods in the `HttpConnection` class are similar in structure and purpose.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. For instance, the `Request` and `Response` classes share some common logic, such as handling headers and cookies.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. This can be seen in the numerous `req` object method calls scattered throughout the file.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `Request` class's method signature were to change, all the methods that call it would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The evidence includes the repetition of similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for significant impact from changes within the file. The numerous method calls and shared logic between classes make it likely that a single change would have a ripple effect throughout the file, requiring many small edits to maintain consistency and functionality."
FireBirdMetaModel.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the step-by-step answers:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is no apparent duplication of logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
While there are interactions with various classes, they are mostly specific to the FireBird database operations and do not indicate a change in one place requiring similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it may affect some of the methods using those rules or structures, but this is not excessive. For example, changing the `OBJECT_NAME_LENGTH` constant might affect `prepareTableLoadStatement` and other methods that use it, but such changes are limited and manageable.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require minimal updates in this file, mainly limited to changing method signatures or field names/accessors.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The class design is straightforward, with simple getters for its fields, and does not exhibit repetitive logic or widespread interactions that would suggest a high risk of Shotgun Surgery."
Location.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are many methods (e.g., `getLocationType()`) that perform similar tasks across different classes (e.g., `EnterLocation`, `LineLocation`, `FieldAccessLocation`, etc.).

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are repeated patterns of logic across multiple methods or classes, such as the way `getLocationType()` is implemented in each location class.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, many classes in this file interact with external classes (e.g., `MethodProcessor`, `BindingContext`, `AsmOpUtils`, etc.), suggesting that changes in one place might require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `LocationType` enum were to change, many `getLocationType()` methods would need to be updated. Similarly, if the `MethodProcessor` or `BindingContext` classes were to change, many methods in this file would be impacted.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The presence of many similar methods, repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and potential for broad impact from changes all suggest that this file shows signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The duplication of logic and similar methods across multiple classes increases the likelihood that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places."
Evaluator.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: There are many methods in this file that perform similar tasks, such as the `matches` method in various subclasses of `Evaluator`. These methods often check if an element matches certain conditions, but the specific conditions vary.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: The logic for checking if an element matches certain conditions is repeated across multiple methods and classes. For example, the `Attribute` and `AttributeWithValue` classes have similar logic for checking if an element has a certain attribute.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: The methods in this file frequently interact with the `Element` class, which suggests that a change in the `Element` class could require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If the `Element` class or the `matches` method signature were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `Element` class added a new method for checking if an element has a certain attribute, many of the evaluator classes would need to be updated to use this new method.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The repetition of similar logic and the widespread interaction with the `Element` class make it likely that changes to this file would be complex and error-prone.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `Compilation` class were to change, methods like `storeCompilation`, `getCompilationByCompileID`, `getCompilationByAddress`, etc. might all need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery. The presence of repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high potential for change impact within the file all contribute to this conclusion."
ParentRunner.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, there are no methods in this file that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a unique responsibility.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there is no repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic is well-structured and modular.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mostly limited to the `TestClass`, `Description`, and `RunNotifier` classes, which is expected given the context of a test runner.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a few methods in this file. For example, if the `TestClass` class were to change, the `getTestClass()` method would need to be updated. However, the impact would be limited to a few specific methods, and the changes would not be widespread or repetitive.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is well-structured, modular, and easy to maintain, with no evidence of duplicated logic or widespread external interactions that would contribute to the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
OmsPortalOrderServiceImpl.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** Yes, there are several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `calcTotalAmount`, `calcPromotionAmount`, `calcCouponAmount`, and `calcIntegrationAmount`, which all calculate different types of amounts. There are also multiple methods for handling coupon and integration logic.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** Yes, there are repeated logic patterns across multiple methods, such as the calculation of amounts and the handling of coupon and integration logic.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** Yes, the methods in this class interact with many different classes, including `UmsMemberService`, `OmsCartItemService`, `UmsMemberReceiveAddressService`, `UmsMemberCouponService`, `SmsCouponHistoryDao`, `OmsOrderMapper`, `PortalOrderItemDao`, `RedisService`, and others. This suggests that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this class were to change, it would likely require updating many methods within this file. For example, if the logic for calculating the total amount of an order changes, it would need to be updated in multiple places.

5. **Summary Judgment:** The presence of repetitive and similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high potential for change impact within the file all suggest that this class is at risk for Shotgun Surgery. A small change in requirements could require making many small, similar changes in multiple places, which is a hallmark of this code smell. Refactoring to reduce duplication and increase modularity could help mitigate this risk."
JUnitCommandLineParseResult.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Most methods have distinct responsibilities, such as parsing command line arguments, creating filter specs, or handling errors.

2. There are no obvious patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic is fairly linear and straightforward.

3. The methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. The interactions are mostly limited to JUnit-related classes and are not overly complex.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it's unlikely to require updating many methods in this file. For example, a change in the `parseOptions` method would likely only affect that method and possibly the `parseArgs` method. A change in the `Computer` class or the `Filter` interface might require updates in the `createRequest` or `applyFilterSpecs` methods, but these are isolated changes.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The methods are mostly independent, and changes to one part of the code are unlikely to have a ripple effect throughout the file."
ClassReader.java,"1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: **Yes**, there are several methods like `readUnsignedShort`, `readInt`, and `readUTF8` that perform similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: **Yes**, patterns like the ones found in the switch statements of the `readUTF` method and the loops in the `accept` and `readMethod` methods are repeated across different parts of the file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: **No**, methods in this file primarily interact with the class's own fields and methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: **Yes**, if the structure of the class file or the byte array `b` were to change, it could potentially require updates in multiple methods within this file. For example, changes to the `readUnsignedShort` or `readInt` methods could impact other parts of the file that rely on these methods.

5. Summary Judgment: This file appears to be a specialized handler for incoming packet messages and does not contain the characteristic repetition or widespread interaction that would suggest a Shotgun Surgery code smell. The code is relatively self-contained and focused on a specific task, making it less likely to be affected by small changes in requirements in multiple places."
ConstrainableInputStream.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.
2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.
3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.
4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating a few methods, but only those directly related to the change. For example, if the way the `remaining` variable is updated were to change, only the `read` method and possibly `reset` would need to be updated.
5. Based on my analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are relatively self-contained and focused on specific tasks related to input stream management, with no repetitive or duplicated logic across the class."

Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks (such as forwarding calls to `GLES20` methods).

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file (for example, `glUniform1f`, `glUniform1fv`, `glUniform2f`, `glUniform2fv`, etc.).

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `GLES20` class were to change, many of the methods in this class would also need to change.

5. Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The presence of many methods that perform similar or repetitive tasks, the duplication of logic across multiple methods, and the widespread external interactions all contribute to this conclusion. If a change were to be made to the `GLES20` class or the underlying data structures, it is likely that many methods in this class would need to be updated, leading to a pattern of shotgun surgery."
SaJwtUtil.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

To analyze this file, I will go step by step:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: This file contains several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `createToken`, `parseToken`, `getPayloads`, `getPayloadsNotCheck`, `getLoginId`, `getLoginIdOrNull`, and `getTimeout`. These methods interact with JWT tokens, making similar checks (e.g., verifying the token's signature and payload) and performing similar operations (e.g., parsing the token, checking its validity). While they are not identical, they do share common patterns and logic.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There are instances of repeated logic across multiple methods, such as checking if a token is null, verifying its signature, and checking its validity. For example, the `parseToken` and `getTimeout` methods both verify the token's signature and check if it's null. The `getPayloads` and `getPayloadsNotCheck` methods also share similarities in how they handle the token's payload.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: The methods in this file frequently interact with the `JWT` class and its methods (e.g., `JWT.create()`, `JWT.of()`, `verify()`, `getPayloads()`). A change in how these interactions are performed (e.g., a change in the `JWT` class) could require similar changes in many methods within this file.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the way tokens are signed or verified changes, methods like `createToken`, `parseToken`, and `getTimeout` would need to be updated. Similarly, if the structure of the token's payload changes, methods like `getPayloads`, `getLoginId`, and `getTimeout` would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The presence of similar methods, repeated logic, and widespread external interactions, combined with the potential for significant change impact within the file, indicate that this file is prone to Shotgun Surgery. This could be due to the file's focus on a specific task (JWT token management) and the reuse of similar logic and patterns across multiple methods, which increases the likelihood that changes will be needed in multiple places."
Code.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as generating ISBN10, ISBN13, EAN8, GTIN8, EAN13, GTIN13 numbers. These methods have similar logic for calculating check digits and formatting the output.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. For example, the `isbn10CheckDigit` and `isbn13CheckDigit` methods have similar logic for calculating check digits, and the `gtin8` and `gtin13` methods have similar logic for generating check digits.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with the `Faker` class, which suggests that a change in the `Faker` class would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule or data structure used in this file were to change (e.g., a change in the ISBN format), it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the ISBN format changes, the `isbn10`, `isbn13`, `isbnGs1`, `isbnGroup`, and `isbnRegistrant` methods would all need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on this analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the presence of repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high change impact within the file. These factors suggest that the code may be prone to Shotgun Surgery."
HomeController.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, there are only two methods (`rest` and `feign`) that perform specific tasks, and they do not seem to be repetitive or similar in nature.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, the methods in this file interact with only a few classes (`RestTemplate`, `OrderService`, and `StorageService`), and the interactions are limited to specific use cases.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only the specific methods that use it. For example, if the `storageService.storage` method signature changes, only the `feign` method would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs of Shotgun Surgery, as there are no repetitive or similar methods, no duplicated logic, and limited external interactions. Any changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures would likely require updating only specific methods, rather than many small edits across the file."
NacosWatch.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods:
   No, the file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, but some methods such as `start()` and `stop()` have similar logic related to event listener registration and unregistration.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
   Yes, there are patterns where similar logic is repeated, such as the use of `properties.getService()`, `properties.getGroup()`, and `properties.getClusterName()` in both `start()` and `stop()` methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
   Yes, the `NacosWatch` class interacts with multiple external classes, including `NacosServiceManager`, `NamingService`, `ApplicationEventPublisher`, and `EventListener`, which could indicate that changes in one of these classes might require similar changes in multiple methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
   Yes, changes to the `properties` object, such as `properties.getService()` or `properties.getGroup()`, could require updates to multiple methods in this file, such as `start()`, `stop()`, `buildKey()`, and `resetIfNeeded()`.

5. Summary Judgment:
   Based on the analysis, the file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes repeated use of similar logic, interaction with multiple external classes, and potential impact of changes to the `properties` object on multiple methods within the file. These factors contribute to the likelihood of Shotgun Surgery if similar patterns exist in other files as well."
DictSegment.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. The DictSegment class contains several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `match(char[] charArray)`, `match(char[] charArray, int begin, int length)`, and `match(char[] charArray, int begin, int length, Hit searchHit)`. These methods have similar logic and could be considered repetitive.

2. The class has repeated logic in the `fillSegment(char[] charArray)` and `disableSegment(char[] charArray)` methods, which both call the `fillSegment(char[] charArray, int begin, int length, int enabled)` method with different enabled values.

3. The DictSegment class interacts with the `Hit` class and the `charMap` map, which could suggest widespread external interactions if these classes/maps are used in multiple other classes.

4. If the `Hit` class or the `charMap` map were to change, it could impact several methods in the DictSegment class, such as the `match` methods and the `fillSegment` methods. For example, if the `Hit` class were to add a new method or field, the `match` methods in DictSegment might need to be updated to use the new method or field.

5. Summary Judgment: The DictSegment class shows signs of Shotgun Surgery due to its repetitive methods, repeated logic, and potential for widespread external interactions. If changes were made to the `Hit` class or the `charMap` map, it could require updates in multiple methods within the DictSegment class. Additionally, the class's use of similar methods and logic could indicate that a small change in requirements could lead to many small edits in multiple places."
RocketMQMessageHandler.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
There are methods in this file like `start()`, `stop()`, `handleMessageInternal()` which perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, such as logging and interactions with `rocketMQTemplate`. However, there are no multiple methods with identical or very similar logic.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There are a few instances of repeated logic, such as checking if `transactional` is true and then performing specific actions, but they are relatively minor and contained within a single method.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
Methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `rocketMQTemplate`, `InstrumentationManager`, `ErrorMessageStrategy`, which could suggest that a change in one place might require similar changes in other methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., `rocketMQTemplate.sendMessageInTransaction`), it would likely require updating the `handleMessageInternal` method. For example, if the signature of `sendMessageInTransaction` changes, the method call in `handleMessageInternal` would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment:
The file shows some signs of Shotgun Surgery. While there are no identical methods performing the same tasks, the widespread interactions with various classes and potential for cascading changes (e.g., updating method calls when a dependency's signature changes) indicate that a small change in requirements could require multiple small edits in multiple places. The primary evidence is the complexity and interconnectedness of the code, particularly within the `handleMessageInternal` method."
NacosDiscoveryProperties.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, there are several getter and setter methods that perform similar tasks, such as `getEndpoint()`, `setEndpoint(String endpoint)`, `getNamespace()`, `setNamespace(String namespace)`, etc.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, the logic for resolving placeholders from environment variables is repeated in multiple places within the `overrideFromEnv(Environment env)` method.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes and environment variables, which could suggest that a change in one place may require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, if the structure of the `NacosDiscoveryProperties` class or any of its methods were to change (e.g., the addition or removal of a field), it could likely require updating several getter and setter methods, as well as potentially updating the `getNacosProperties()` method or the `overrideFromEnv(Environment env)` method.

5. Summary Judgment: 
The presence of repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for a change in the class structure to have a broad impact on the code all contribute to the likelihood that a small change in requirements could require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The extensive use of environment variables and the potential for changes in these variables to have a ripple effect throughout the codebase also supports this conclusion."
HtmlTreeBuilderStateTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. No, there are no repetitive or similar methods that perform small or repetitive tasks in this file.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. No, changing a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file would not likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, updating the `findConstantArrays` method would not affect the test methods, and changing the test methods would not impact the helper methods like `ensureSorted`.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods have clear, distinct responsibilities, and there is no evidence of duplicated or similar logic that would lead to Shotgun Surgery."
QuotedStringTokenizer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   There are several overloaded constructors and methods with similar functionality, but they serve different purposes and are not repetitive in a way that would indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   The logic within the methods is mostly unique and focused on specific tasks, with some methods building upon others, but there is no clear duplication of logic across multiple methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   The class primarily interacts with its own methods and a few external classes (like StringTokenizer and StringBuffer), but these interactions are relatively contained and do not suggest a widespread need for similar changes across many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   If a business rule or method signature were to change, it might require updates to a few related methods, particularly those involved in tokenization and quoting/unquoting logic. For example, changing the handling of quotes or delimiters could impact the `hasMoreTokens()`, `nextToken()`, `quote()`, and `unquote()` methods. However, this does not necessarily imply a Shotgun Surgery situation since these changes would be relatively focused within the class.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   Based on the analysis, the provided Java file does not show significant signs of Shotgun Surgery. The class is designed to handle string tokenization with quoting support, and its methods, while numerous, are generally focused on specific aspects of this functionality without unnecessary duplication or widespread interactions that would suggest a high likelihood of requiring many small, similar changes across the codebase."
CodeCacheStage.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   There is one method `addToGraph` that performs a small, specific task and another method `showLabel` that also performs a small task. The `redraw` method is the main method that does a significant amount of work. However, these methods do not seem to be repetitive or similar enough to indicate Shotgun Surgery.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   The logic within the `redraw` method is unique and not repeated across multiple methods within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   Methods in this file interact with a limited number of classes, specifically `JITWatchUI` and `UserInterfaceUtil`. The interactions are mostly confined to getting data or utilizing utility methods, which doesn't suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating a few methods. For instance, if the `CodeCacheEvent` data structure were to change, it would likely require updating the `redraw` method. However, it doesn't seem that many small edits in multiple places would be necessary.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   This file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of Shotgun Surgery. The methods and logic are fairly contained within this class, and external interactions are limited."
HTTPSession.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, the file contains several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `decodeHeader`, `decodeMultipartFormData`, and `decodeParms`, which all deal with decoding different parts of an HTTP request.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns of repeated logic across multiple methods, for example, the use of `ByteBuffer` and `FileChannel` in `getTmpBucket` and `saveTmpFile`, or the handling of exceptions in multiple methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as `BufferedInputStream`, `OutputStream`, `ByteArrayInputStream`, `DataOutputStream`, `RandomAccessFile`, `FileChannel`, and `ITempFile`, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the format of the HTTP request headers were to change, methods like `decodeHeader` and `getBoundaryPositions` would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the presence of repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high impact of changes within the file. This suggests that the code is prone to the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
ParserConfig.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `addItemsToDeny`, `addItemsToDeny0`, and `addItemsToAccept`, which all add items to different lists. Additionally, there are many similar methods for getting and setting deserializers.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: The logic for checking and handling auto-type is repeated in several places, such as in the `getDeserializer` and `checkAutoType` methods. There are also repeated checks for `null` and empty strings in various methods.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: The `ParserConfig` class interacts with many other classes, including `ASMDeserializerFactory`, `JavaBeanInfo`, `TypeUtils`, and `JSON`, which could make it difficult to change one class without affecting others.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, such as the auto-type support, were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file, such as `getDeserializer`, `checkAutoType`, and `initDeserializers`. For example, if the auto-type support were to be removed, all the methods that check for it would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is a characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The repetitive methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions all contribute to this smell. A change to one part of the code could have a ripple effect and require changes to many other parts, making the code difficult to maintain and modify."

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with other classes, such as `CommandAsyncExecutor`, `TransactionalOperation`, `RLock`, and `RedissonPromise`, which could lead to multiple places needing to be updated if any of these classes change.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `TransactionalOperation` class were to change, multiple methods in this class that add operations to the `operations` list would need to be updated. Additionally, if the `state` field or its handling were to change, multiple methods that use or update `state` would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the repetition of similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and potential for changes to have a broad impact within the file, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the presence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
HttpClientRequestContext.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. The methods are mostly getter and setter methods for two fields.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The methods are simple and do not contain complex logic.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The file only contains getter and setter methods for two fields.

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely not require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `HttpUriRequest` class were to change, only the getter and setter methods for `httpUriRequest` would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are simple and do not contain repeated logic, and changes to the data structures or method signatures used in this file would likely have a limited impact."
DefaultMQAdminExtImpl.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The provided Java file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as updating various configurations, examining different types of information, and querying data from brokers. These methods are similar in that they all interact with the `mqClientInstance` to perform their respective tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There are many methods that contain repeated logic. For example, methods like `updateBrokerConfig`, `getBrokerConfig`, `createAndUpdateTopicConfig`, `createAndUpdatePlainAccessConfig`, and others all make similar calls to `this.mqClientInstance.getMQClientAPIImpl()` to perform their respective tasks.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
The methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially the `MQClientAPIImpl` class. This suggests that a change in one place could require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `MQClientAPIImpl` class changed its method signatures, many methods in this file would need to be updated to reflect those changes.

5. Summary Judgment: 
The evidence suggests that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The file contains many similar methods that interact with the same classes, and a change in one place could have a ripple effect, requiring changes in many other places."
Settings.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, there are no methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks within this file. Most methods are getter/setter or simple property accessors.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there is no repeated logic across multiple methods within this file. The logic is mostly focused on handling property changes and saving the settings.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mostly within the same class or with its properties.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating a moderate number of methods, but not necessarily many small edits. For example, changing the type of a property would require updating its getter and setter methods, as well as any methods that use that property. However, the impact is still relatively contained within the file.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show strong signs of Shotgun Surgery. While changing certain properties or methods might require some updates, the impact is relatively localized and manageable. The file's structure and logic do not suggest a high risk of requiring many small, similar changes in multiple places."
ConnectionPageShellCommands.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. Here are my answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods:** No, there are no many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Most of the methods are specific to the functionality of this class and are not repetitive.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic:** No, I did not find patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions:** No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File:** If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating a few methods in this file. For example, if the `DBRShellCommand` class changes, the `updateEvent` method may need to be updated. However, this would not likely require updating many methods.

5. **Summary Judgment:** Based on my analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). While there might be some updates needed in response to changes in the `DBRShellCommand` class or other dependencies, these do not suggest a widespread Shotgun Surgery issue within this file itself."
MailUtil.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. The file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as sending emails with different parameters. For example, there are multiple `send` methods with different parameter combinations.

2. There are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. For example, the `sendText` and `sendHtml` methods have similar logic, with the main difference being the `isHtml` parameter.

3. Methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. For example, the `send` methods all interact with the `MailAccount` class and the `Session` class.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `MailAccount` class were to change, multiple `send` methods would need to be updated. Additionally, if the email sending logic were to change, multiple `send` methods would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes the repetitive methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions. For example, if a new email sending feature were to be added, multiple `send` methods would likely need to be updated, which could lead to maintenance issues and errors."
HttpRequestMethodsMatcherTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, the file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely only affect a few methods. For example, if the `getMethods()` method in `HttpRequestMethodsMatcher` were to change, it would affect the `testEqualsAndHashCode` method in this file. However, the impact is limited to this single test class.

5. Summary Judgment: The file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the methods are distinct and do not share repetitive or similar logic."
SymbolInfo.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. The file contains a few methods that perform similar tasks, such as the multiple overloaded `lookup` methods.

2. Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. For example, the `getHorizontalDataRegions` and `getVerticalDataRegions` methods contain similar switch statements.

3. Methods in this file do interact with other classes, such as the `Dimension` class, but the interaction is not widespread.

4. If the `SymbolInfo` class or its methods (e.g., `lookup`, `getSymbolWidth`) were to change, it would likely require updating multiple methods in this file. For example, if the `dataRegions` field were to be changed, the `getHorizontalDataRegions` and `getVerticalDataRegions` methods would need to be updated. Additionally, any external classes that use the `lookup` method would need to be updated if the method signature were to change.

5. Summary Judgment: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery, primarily due to the repetitive logic in the `getHorizontalDataRegions` and `getVerticalDataRegions` methods, as well as the potential for widespread changes if the `SymbolInfo` class or its methods were to change."
TextureAtlas.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. 

Here are the step-by-step answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: While there are many methods in the provided Java file, they do not seem to perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method appears to serve a distinct purpose within the TextureAtlas class, such as loading data, adding regions, finding regions, or creating sprites.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There doesn't appear to be duplicated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic for handling texture atlases, regions, and sprites seems to be encapsulated within their respective classes and methods without repetition.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: The methods in this file interact with classes related to textures, regions, and sprites, which are necessary for the functionality of the TextureAtlas class. However, the interactions are not overly widespread or suggestive of a pattern that would require uniform changes across many different classes if one aspect were to change.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require some updates within the file, but the changes would likely be contained within specific aspects of the TextureAtlas or related classes (like AtlasRegion or AtlasSprite). The file's design suggests that changes could be managed within the relevant classes or methods without necessitating a broad, shotgun-like approach to making edits.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not exhibit strong signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The design and organization of the classes and methods appear to encapsulate logic and interactions in a way that would facilitate localized changes in response to new requirements or modifications, rather than requiring many small, similar edits across the file."
ImmutableEnumMap.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
The class contains multiple methods (e.g., `keyIterator`, `keySpliterator`, `containsKey`, `get`, `entryIterator`, `entrySpliterator`, `forEach`) that delegate their actions to the `delegate` EnumMap. These methods perform similar tasks, which could be considered repetitive.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There are no obvious patterns of duplicated or repeated logic within the methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Methods in this file frequently interact with the `delegate` EnumMap, but this interaction is limited to a single class.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If the `delegate` EnumMap or its methods were to change, many methods in this file would likely require updates (e.g., `keyIterator`, `keySpliterator`, `containsKey`, `get`, `entryIterator`, `entrySpliterator`, `forEach`).

5. Summary Judgment: 
This file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery because multiple methods delegate to the `delegate` EnumMap, which could lead to a situation where changes to the `EnumMap` class or its methods would require updates in many places."
CharacterReader.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `consumeTo()`, `consumeToAny()`, `consumeToEnd()`, `consumeLetterSequence()`, `consumeDigitSequence()`, and others that all share a similar pattern of consuming characters from the input stream.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. For example, the `bufferUp()` method is called by many other methods, and there are repeated checks for `isEmpty()` or `bufPos < bufLength`.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with the `Reader` class and other external classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `charBuf` array were to be replaced with a different data structure, many methods would need to be updated to accommodate this change.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery, as many small changes in requirements could require similar edits in multiple places. The repeated patterns of similar methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions all contribute to this conclusion. For instance, if a new character encoding scheme were to be added, it would likely require changes to many of the `consume*` methods, as well as updates to the `bufferUp()` and `cacheString()` methods."
ArgumentTokenizer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. There are only two main methods: `tokenize(String)` and `tokenize(String, boolean)`, with the latter being a more general version of the former, and `_escapeQuotesAndBackslashes(String)` which is a helper method.

2. There are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. The `tokenize(String, boolean)` method uses a complex state machine to tokenize the input string, but it does not repeat logic in multiple places.

3. Methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The class is designed to be self-contained, with only a few static methods that interact with standard Java classes like `String` and `LinkedList`.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only the `tokenize(String, boolean)` method or the `_escapeQuotesAndBackslashes(String)` method. For example, if the rules for tokenizing strings were to change, only the state machine logic in `tokenize(String, boolean)` would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The methods are relatively self-contained and do not repeat logic or interact with many different classes, making it unlikely that Shotgun Surgery would be required."

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a few specific methods in this file. For example, if the `XxlJobLogDao` interface were to change, the methods that use it, such as `pageList` and `logDetailPage`, would need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The methods in this file are relatively independent and do not exhibit a high degree of similarity or duplication."

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There is no pattern of the same or very similar logic being repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Methods in this file do interact with some external classes, but it's not frequent or widespread to the extent that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Some changes, such as modifying the request or response handling, might require updating a few methods or lines in this file, but it's not extensive.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is relatively focused on a specific task and does not exhibit the widespread repetition or external interactions typically associated with Shotgun Surgery."
HistoryPageFilter.java,"1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, there are several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `addQueueItem()` and `addRun()`, which both add entries to the history page, and `fitsSearchParams()` for `Queue.Item` and `Run`, which both check if the search string matches certain fields.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, some logic is repeated, for example, in `fitsSearchParams()` methods for `Queue.Item` and `Run`, which both contain the same conditional checks.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, the class interacts with many different classes, including `Queue.Item`, `Run`, `Job`, `Queue`, `ParametersAction`, and `UserSearchProperty`, which could make it difficult to change or replace any of these dependencies.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, if a business rule or data structure used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `HistoryPageEntry` class were to change, both `addQueueItem()` and `addRun()` methods would need to be updated. Similarly, if the search logic were to change, both `fitsSearchParams()` methods would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: 
YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. The evidence includes repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for a change in one place to require similar changes in many methods."
HandshakeData.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. The methods are mostly getter methods for the class fields.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, changing the type of the 'time' field from Date to another type would require updating only a few methods (getTime() and possibly the constructor).

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, indicating the absence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The methods are simple and mostly limited to getting and setting class fields, and there are no repetitive or duplicated logic patterns that would suggest widespread changes would be required in response to a small change in requirements."
Vault.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery. Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are several methods that perform similar tasks, such as `isLocked()`, `isProcessing()`, `isUnlocked()`, `isMissing()`, `isNeedsMigration()`, and `isUnknownError()`, which all return a boolean value based on the state of the vault. Additionally, there are multiple `BooleanBinding` properties that also relate to the state of the vault, such as `locked`, `processing`, `unlocked`, `missing`, `needsMigration`, and `unknownError`.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, the logic for determining the state of the vault is repeated across multiple methods, such as `isLocked()`, `isProcessing()`, etc. Additionally, the `createCryptoFileSystem()` method and the `destroyCryptoFileSystem()` method have similar logic for handling the creation and destruction of the crypto file system.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, the `Vault` class interacts with several other classes, including `Volume`, `VaultSettings`, `CryptoFileSystem`, and `VaultState`, which could suggest that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if the business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `VaultState` enum were to change, it would require updating all the methods that use it, such as `isLocked()`, `isProcessing()`, etc. Additionally, if the `CryptoFileSystem` class were to change, it would require updating the `createCryptoFileSystem()` and `destroyCryptoFileSystem()` methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The evidence suggests that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The repetition of similar methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions all contribute to this conclusion. If a change were to be made to the `VaultState` enum or the `CryptoFileSystem` class, for example, it would likely require updating multiple methods in the `Vault` class, which could lead to the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
CommandDecoder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No, this file does not appear to contain many methods that perform similar tasks.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
There are some patterns of repeated logic, such as the handling of different Redis error codes in the `decode` method, but this is relatively contained.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
The `decode` and `decodeCommand` methods interact with several other classes and methods, but this is largely related to the specific task of decoding Redis commands.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it could potentially require updating several methods, such as the `decodeCommand` and `decode` methods. For example, changes to the Redis protocol or command structure could impact these methods.

5. Summary Judgment: 
While there are some areas where changes could potentially have a ripple effect, the code does not show widespread evidence of Shotgun Surgery. The logic and interactions are relatively contained and focused on the specific task of decoding Redis commands."
FxApplication.java,"1. No, this file does not appear to contain many repetitive or similar methods, as each method has distinct functionality.

2. No, there are no obvious patterns of duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods within this file, as each method performs a specific task.

3. Yes, some methods in this file interact with various classes, such as `VaultService`, `LicenseHolder`, `TrayIntegrationProvider`, and `UiAppearanceProvider`, which could indicate widespread external interactions.

4. Yes, changes to certain business rules, data structures, or method signatures used in this file, such as the `UiTheme` or `VaultState`, might require updating multiple methods. For example, if the `UiTheme` enum were to be modified, it could affect the `loadSelectedStyleSheet` method, which uses a switch statement to apply the desired theme.

5. NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery. Although there are some interactions with multiple classes and potential impacts from changes to specific data structures or method signatures, the overall structure of the code does not strongly suggest that a small change in requirements would necessitate numerous small edits in multiple places."

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is indicative of the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
BatchExecutor.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: Yes, there are several methods (doUpdate, doQuery, doQueryCursor, doFlushStatements) that perform similar tasks such as handling statements, connections, and transactions.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods, such as the creation and preparation of statement handlers, connections, and transactions.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as StatementHandler, MappedStatement, Configuration, and Transaction, which suggests that a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, a change in the MappedStatement class or the StatementHandler interface would likely require updating the doUpdate, doQuery, and doQueryCursor methods.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The evidence includes repetitive and similar methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and a high change impact within the file. This suggests that the Shotgun Surgery code smell is present in this file."
TokenQueue.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the step-by-step answers:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Each method has a distinct purpose and functionality.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. The methods are well-structured and unique.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The methods mostly operate on the internal state of the `TokenQueue` class.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a few related methods in this file. For example, if the `consume` method signature were to change, the `consumeTo`, `consumeToIgnoreCase`, and `chompTo` methods might need to be updated. However, the impact would be contained within the `TokenQueue` class.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is a characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The methods are well-organized, and the impact of changes is likely to be contained within the `TokenQueue` class."
DubboServiceMetadataRepository.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the detailed answers:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: 
   There are some methods that have similar tasks, such as `exportURL` and `unexportURL`, but they do not seem to be repetitive or small tasks. Most methods have distinct functionalities, and there isn't an apparent repetition.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: 
   There isn't significant repeated logic within the provided class. The logic seems to be well-organized, and there aren't multiple methods with the same logic.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: 
   This class does interact with several other classes and services, such as `DubboMetadataServiceProxy`, `DiscoveryClient`, and `DubboMetadataUtils`. However, these interactions do not seem excessive or suggest a high likelihood of requiring changes in many methods if one interaction changes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: 
   If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require some updates in this file, especially if the change affects how metadata is stored or retrieved. However, this does not imply a Shotgun Surgery issue since the changes would likely be confined to the related methods or areas of the class.

5. **Summary Judgment**: 
   Based on the analysis, this file does not strongly exhibit signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. While there are some interactions with external services and potential for change impact, the class's structure and logic distribution do not suggest that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small, similar edits across multiple places within this file."
FakeValuesService.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery.

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, the file contains methods like `fetch`, `fetchString`, and `safeFetch` that perform similar tasks. These methods seem to fetch data from a YAML file or from the `Faker` object, but with slightly different behavior. Additionally, there are multiple methods that resolve expressions, such as `resolveExpression` and its overloaded versions.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, there are patterns where similar logic is repeated across multiple methods. For example, the `resolveExpression` method and its overloaded versions contain similar logic to resolve expressions. The `accessor` method also has similar logic to find an accessor by name, ignoring case.

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. For example, the `FakeValuesService` class interacts with `Faker`, `Address`, `Name`, and other classes.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the structure of the YAML file changes, the `fetch` and `resolveExpression` methods would need to be updated. Similarly, if the `Faker` object's method signatures change, the `resolveFakerObjectAndMethod` method would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery. The file contains repetitive or similar methods, duplicated or repeated logic, and widespread external interactions. A small change in requirements would likely require many small edits in multiple places. The file's complexity and tight coupling make it prone to Shotgun Surgery. Specifically, the `resolveExpression` method and its overloaded versions, as well as the `accessor` method, would require updates if the underlying data structures or method signatures change."
PassphraseEntryController.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions step by step:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No repetitive or similar methods found.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
The animation-related methods and properties, such as `startUnlockAnimation`, `stopUnlockAnimation`, and the KeyFrames in the `unlockAnimation` Timeline, show similarity and repetition in logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
The class interacts with many external classes and interfaces like `KeychainManager`, `Vault`, `ForgetPasswordComponent`, `UserInteractionLock`, and others, which could lead to Shotgun Surgery if changes are made to these dependencies.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Changes to the business rules, data structures, or method signatures related to password handling, keychain access, or vault unlocking would likely require updates to multiple methods and properties within this file, such as `unlock`, `didClickSavePasswordCheckbox`, `getUnlockButtonContentDisplay`, and others.

5. Summary Judgment: 
The presence of similar logic in the animation-related methods, interactions with multiple external classes, and the potential for wide-reaching changes within the file due to updates in business rules or data structures indicate a risk of Shotgun Surgery in this code. The complexity of the animation logic and the mixing of concerns (password handling, animation, and user interaction) contribute to this risk."
LexemePath.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, there are no repetitive or similar methods in this file that perform small, repetitive tasks.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there are no patterns of duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods in this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a limited number of methods in this file. For example, if the `Lexeme` class changes, the `addCrossLexeme` and `addNotCrossLexeme` methods might need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs of Shotgun Surgery. The methods are relatively self-contained and do not have duplicated logic or widespread external interactions."
PullAPIWrapper.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: There are methods like `updatePullFromWhichNode`, `hasHook`, `executeHook`, and `registerFilterMessageHook` that perform small tasks, but they are not overly repetitive. However, methods like `processPullResult` and `pullKernelImpl` contain complex logic and multiple operations, which could indicate a potential for similar methods elsewhere in the codebase.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: The `pullKernelImpl` method checks if `findBrokerResult` is `null` and then performs some actions. This logic could be considered repetitive if similar checks are performed in other methods or classes.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Methods like `pullKernelImpl` interact with multiple classes and interfaces, such as `MQClientInstance`, `MessageQueue`, `PullMessageRequestHeader`, and `PullCallback`. This could indicate that changes in these classes or interfaces might require similar changes in multiple methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If the `MessageQueue` or `PullResult` classes were to change, it would likely require updates in multiple methods within this file, such as `processPullResult` and `pullKernelImpl`. For example, if a new field were added to `MessageQueue`, methods that create or use `MessageQueue` objects might need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: This file shows signs of potential Shotgun Surgery due to the presence of complex methods, interactions with multiple external classes, and potential for repetitive logic. The impact of changes to certain classes or interfaces could ripple through multiple methods, indicating a potential for Shotgun Surgery. Specifically, changes to `MessageQueue`, `PullResult`, or other closely related classes could require updates in multiple places within this file and potentially elsewhere in the codebase."
ParamFlowChecker.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. No, the file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating a few methods in this file, but it does not seem likely to require updating many methods. For example, if the `ParamFlowRule` class were to change, it might require updating the `passCheck` method.

5. Summary Judgment: This file does not show strong signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. While it is possible that changes to certain classes or methods used in this file could require updates to multiple methods, the file itself does not appear to have the kind of repetitive or duplicated code that is typically associated with Shotgun Surgery."
SaTokenContextForThreadLocalStorage.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. The methods in this file are mostly related to setting, getting, and clearing the `Box` object.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. Widespread External Interactions: No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The interactions are mainly with the `Box` class and the classes it contains (`SaRequest`, `SaResponse`, and `SaStorage`).

4. Change Impact Within the File: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a few methods in this file, but not many. For example, if the `Box` class were to change, the `setBox`, `getBox`, and `clearBox` methods might need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The methods and classes in this file are relatively simple and focused on a specific task, with minimal repetition or duplication of logic."
AbortedTransactionException.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, as it only has constructors.

2. There is no repeated logic across multiple methods in this file, since all methods are constructors with similar but distinct purpose (initializing the exception with different parameters).

3. The methods in this file do not interact with many different classes; they only extend the JedisDataException class.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating a few constructors, but not many methods in general, as there are only three constructors and they are straightforward.

5. Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The code is simple and well-structured, with minimal potential for widespread changes due to a single requirement modification."
HttpRequest.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: Yes, there are many methods that perform similar tasks, such as `setConnectionTimeout`, `setReadTimeout`, `setChunkedStreamingMode`, which set different properties of the `HttpRequest` object.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: Yes, there are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file, such as the logic for setting different headers (e.g., `contentType`, `cookie`, `authorization`).

3. Widespread External Interactions: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially the `HttpConnection` class, and other utility classes like `UrlBuilder`, `SSLUtil`, etc.

4. Change Impact Within the File: Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the logic for handling HTTPS connections changes, several methods that set up HTTPS connections may need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The file has many similar methods and repeated logic, and it interacts with many different classes, making it prone to the Shotgun Surgery code smell. This could be addressed by refactoring the code to reduce duplication and improve modularity."
ProxyDatabaseMetaData.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, the file contains many methods that perform similar tasks. All the ResultSet methods are similar, where they get the resultSet from the delegate, get the statement from the resultSet, proxy the statement, and then return a proxy resultSet.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, the same logic is repeated across multiple methods. The logic to get the statement from the resultSet and then proxy the statement is repeated in all the ResultSet methods.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, such as ProxyFactory, ProxyStatement, and ProxyResultSet. 

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the way ProxyFactory creates proxy statements or result sets changes, all the ResultSet methods would need to be updated.

5. Summary Judgment: 
Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. This is because there are many similar methods that perform repetitive tasks, there is repeated logic across these methods, and these methods interact with many external classes. This suggests that this code may be prone to Shotgun Surgery. 

Examples of evidence include: 
- The many similar ResultSet methods that all follow a similar pattern.
- The repeated logic to get and proxy the statement in these methods.
- The widespread interaction with external classes like ProxyFactory.
- The potential impact of changes to business rules, data structures, or method signatures on many methods in this file."
MethodCallInliner.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely not require updating many methods in this file. For example, the `shouldBeInlined` method is an abstract method that is responsible for determining whether a method should be inlined, which is a single point of change.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on my analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, i.e., Shotgun Surgery. The structure of the class and its methods appear to be organized and focused on a specific task, with minimal repetition and duplication."
IKArbitrator.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
Yes, the `judge` and `forwardPath` methods perform similar tasks, such as traversing the Lexeme chain and constructing a no-ambiguity Lexeme combination.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
Yes, the logic for handling the last path in the `process` method is almost identical to the logic inside the while loop.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
Yes, the `process` method interacts with multiple classes, including `AnalyzeContext`, `QuickSortSet`, `LexemePath`, and `Lexeme`, suggesting that changes to these classes could require similar changes in the `process` method.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
Yes, if the `LexemePath` class or the `AnalyzeContext` class were to change, it would likely require updating multiple methods in this file, such as `process`, `judge`, `forwardPath`, and `backPath`.

5. Summary Judgment: 
The evidence suggests that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. This is due to the repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and high impact of changes within the file. Specifically, the `process` method's handling of the last path, the traversal logic in `judge` and `forwardPath`, and the interactions with multiple classes all contribute to the likelihood of Shotgun Surgery."
SingleRoomBroadcastOperations.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery 

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks, except for some similarities in event sending methods.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic:
There is some repeated logic in the `sendEvent` method overloads, but the code does not contain large amounts of duplicated logic.

3. Widespread External Interactions:
The `SingleRoomBroadcastOperations` class interacts with `SocketIOClient` and `StoreFactory`, but these interactions are not overly complex or widespread.

4. Change Impact Within the File:
If a business rule or data structure used in this file were to change (e.g., the `Packet` class or the `DispatchMessage` class), it might require updating a few methods in this file. However, this does not seem to be a significant issue, given the relatively small number of potentially affected methods (e.g., `send`, `dispatch`, and some of the `sendEvent` overloads).

5. Summary Judgment:
Based on the analysis, this file does not show clear signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, as the `SingleRoomBroadcastOperations` class appears to be relatively self-contained and its methods are straightforward. However, it's essential to consider the broader codebase to confirm this assessment."
Lorem.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: 
   The file contains several overloaded methods (e.g., `character()`, `characters()`, `sentence()`, etc.) that perform similar tasks, but most of them seem to be forwarding calls with default parameters or making minor adjustments to the inputs. However, there aren't many methods that are almost identical or extremely similar, with only minor differences.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**:
   There isn't an obvious case of duplicated logic in this file. Overloaded methods usually call another method in the same class with more parameters, which is a common and acceptable pattern in Java.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**:
   The methods in this file mostly interact with the `Faker` object passed to the constructor and the utility methods from `org.apache.commons.lang3`. There aren't many different classes being interacted with, and the interactions seem to be well-contained.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**:
   If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change (e.g., the way the `Faker` object is used, or the logic inside `characters()` or `sentence()`), it's likely that only a small subset of methods would need to be updated. For example, if the way random characters are generated changes, it would mostly affect methods like `characters(int fixedNumberOfCharacters, boolean includeUppercase, boolean includeDigit)`.

5. **Summary Judgment**:
   Based on the analysis, this file does not show strong signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. While there are some repetitive or similar methods due to method overloading, the logic within them is generally distinct enough and not duplicated across multiple classes or methods, and interactions with external classes are contained and not widespread."
HostAndPort.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.
2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.
3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes.
4. Yes, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating multiple methods in this file. For example, if the range of valid port numbers were to change, the `isValidPort`, `fromString`, `fromParts`, and `withDefaultPort` methods would all need to be updated.
5. Based on my analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require small edits in multiple places. The evidence is that several methods (`fromString`, `fromParts`, `withDefaultPort`, and `requireBracketsForIPv6`) all rely on the `hasBracketlessColons` field or the valid port number range, and a change to these would require updates in multiple places."
DefaultJSONParser.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: The provided Java file contains several methods that perform similar tasks, such as parsing different data types (e.g., `parseObject`, `parseArray`, `parseKey`). These methods have similar structures and could potentially be refactored to reduce duplication.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There are patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file. For example, the `parseObject` and `parseArray` methods have similar logic for handling different data types.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, especially in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods. For instance, the `parseObject` method interacts with various deserializer classes, which could lead to widespread changes if any of these deserializers are modified.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods in this file. For example, if the `JSONLexer` class is modified, it could affect multiple methods in the `DefaultJSONParser` class that rely on it.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file shows signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is a characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The evidence includes repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and the potential for widespread changes within the file due to changes in external dependencies."
AutoLocker.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

Here are the step-by-step answers:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, the `tick` method interacts with multiple classes (e.g., `ScheduledExecutorService`, `ObservableList`, `Vault`), which could suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: Yes, if the business rule or data structure related to auto-locking were to change, it would likely require updating multiple methods in this file, such as `exceedsIdleTime` and `autolock`. For example, if the idle timeout logic changes, both `exceedsIdleTime` and `autolock` might need to be updated.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the widespread external interactions and the potential change impact within the file, there are signs that a small change in requirements could require many small edits in multiple places, which indicates the presence of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The evidence lies in the interactions between `AutoLocker` and multiple classes, as well as the potential ripple effect of changes to the auto-locking logic."
ReedSolomonDecoder.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. While the `decode` method calls several other methods, each of these methods has a distinct and well-defined responsibility.

2. No, there are no repeated patterns of the same or very similar logic across multiple methods in this file. The logic in each method is unique to its purpose.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes. The classes used (like `GenericGFPoly` and `GenericGF`) are related to the specific domain of Reed-Solomon decoding, and their interactions are contained within the decoder's logic.

4. If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updates in a few methods within this file, especially if the change affects the core decoding logic (e.g., in `runEuclideanAlgorithm`, `findErrorLocations`, or `findErrorMagnitudes`). However, due to the encapsulated nature of the decoder and its methods, the impact of such changes seems limited to this class.

5. Summary Judgment: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would necessitate many small edits across multiple places within the file itself. The logic and methods are well-defined, focused on the specific task of Reed-Solomon decoding, and do not exhibit the kind of redundancy or broad, shallow interaction with other classes that typically characterizes the Shotgun Surgery code smell."
ExecutionSequencer.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

1. No, this file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. No, methods in this file do not frequently interact with many different classes in a way that suggests a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. No, if a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would not likely require updating many methods in this file.

5. Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places (i.e., Shotgun Surgery). The evidence suggests that the file is well-structured and maintainable, with no clear indicators of Shotgun Surgery."
DirectedGraphConnections.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   Yes, this file contains many methods that perform similar tasks. For instance, the `removePredecessor`, `removeSuccessor`, `addPredecessor`, and `addSuccessor` methods all interact with the `adjacentNodeValues` map in a similar way. They check for the existance of a predecessor or successor in the map and update the counts accordingly. This similarity suggests that if the requirements for these operations changed, it would require updating multiple places.

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   Yes, there are patterns where the same logic is repeated. For instance, the `predecessors` and `successors` methods both create an `AbstractSet` and override the `iterator`, `size`, and `contains` methods. The `incidentEdgeIterator` method has two branches that perform similar operations, one with `orderedNodeConnections` and one without.

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with other classes. For example, `GraphConstants`, `EndpointPair`, `Function`, `Iterators`, and `AbstractIterator` are all external classes that are used by methods in this file. If the interfaces of these classes changed, it could require changes in multiple places in this file.

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   Yes, if a business rule or data structure used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating many methods. For example, if the `adjacentNodeValues` map were to be replaced with a different data structure, multiple methods would need to be updated to work with the new structure. Another example is the `incidentEdgeIterator` method which has complex logic to handle self-loops. If the requirements for handling self-loops changed, it would likely require updating this method.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   Based on the analysis, this file shows signs of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. The repetitive methods, duplicated logic, and widespread external interactions all suggest that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The use of similar logic in multiple methods and the frequent interaction with external classes increase the likelihood of this smell."
HttpServerTest.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, there do not appear to be many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There are some repeated patterns in the `testMultipartFormData` and `testTempFileInterface` methods where an HTTP server is started, a request is sent, and the response is checked, but these patterns do not seem excessive or unnecessary.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Some methods in this file interact with multiple external classes, such as `NanoHTTPD` and `HttpClient`, but this interaction seems to be a necessary part of the functionality being tested.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it might require updating some methods, but the impact seems limited to specific areas of the file.

5. **Summary Judgment**: The analysis does not suggest that small changes in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, which is the characteristic of the Shotgun Surgery code smell. While there are some repeated patterns and interactions with external classes, these do not seem excessive or indicative of a broader problem."
ServiceLoader.java,"1. Repetitive or Similar Methods: 
   NO 

2. Duplicated or Repeated Logic: 
   NO 

3. Widespread External Interactions: 
   YES 

4. Change Impact Within the File: 
   YES, a change in the method signature of `load` or the structure of the data being loaded would likely require updating many parts of this file.

5. Summary Judgment: 
   YES, I found Shotgun Surgery, due to widespread external interactions and potential change impact within the file, which could indicate a need for many small edits in multiple places if a small change in requirements were to occur."
JedisSentinelPool.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the detailed answers:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: The file does not contain many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks. Although there are multiple constructors, they all have distinct purposes and are required for the class's functionality. The other methods are unique and do not exhibit repetitive behavior.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: There is no apparent duplicated or repeated logic across multiple methods or classes within this file. The logic is well-structured and specific to each method.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Methods in this file interact with a few classes, such as `Jedis`, `JedisFactory`, and `MasterListener`. However, these interactions are necessary and do not suggest a change in one place would require similar changes in many methods.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it is likely that only a few specific methods would be affected. For example, if the `Jedis` class were to change, only methods directly interacting with `Jedis` would need updates, such as `initSentinels` and `getResource`.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show significant signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places. The structure of the class and its methods suggests that changes can be isolated and managed without widespread modifications."
SimpleEchoSocket.java,"YES, I found Shotgun Surgery

1. Yes, there are similar methods like `getReceivedMessages()` and `getToSendMessages()` that perform small, repetitive tasks.

2. Yes, similar logic is repeated in `onClose()` and `onConnect()` methods for handling connection events, and also in `onConnect()` and `onMessage()` for handling message sending and receiving.

3. Yes, the `SimpleEchoSocket` class frequently interacts with the `Session` class from `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.api`, especially in the `onConnect()` method, suggesting that changes in one place might require similar changes in multiple methods.

4. If the business rule for handling WebSocket connections were to change (for example, changing the disconnect logic or message handling), it would likely require updating multiple methods in this file, such as `onClose()`, `onConnect()`, and `onMessage()`.

5. Summary Judgment: The evidence suggests that this file shows signs of Shotgun Surgery, including repetitive methods, duplicated logic, widespread external interactions, and potential for cascading changes within the file."
RestAdapter.java,"NO, I did not find Shotgun Surgery.

Here are the answers to the questions:

1. **Repetitive or Similar Methods**: No, there are no many methods that perform similar, small, or repetitive tasks in this file.

2. **Duplicated or Repeated Logic**: No, there are no patterns where the same or very similar logic is repeated across multiple methods or classes within this file.

3. **Widespread External Interactions**: Yes, methods in this file frequently interact with many different classes, but this is due to the adapter's role in connecting different components.

4. **Change Impact Within the File**: If a business rule, data structure, or method signature used in this file were to change, it would likely require updating only the specific method or functionality that uses that rule, structure, or signature.

5. **Summary Judgment**: Based on the analysis, this file does not show signs that a small change in requirements would require many small edits in multiple places, i.e., Shotgun Surgery. The file's structure is modular, and changes are likely to be localized to specific methods or classes."
